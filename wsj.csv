 CIO Insights and Analysis from Deloitte 
 Artificial intelligence, chatbots, and other cognitive tools are giving recruiters new ways to attract the right talent and strengthen their employment brand, according to Deloitte’s 2017 Global Human Capital Trends report. CIOs can add considerable value by helping to drive this new approach. 
 CIOs who rethink business processes and take an everything-a-service approach to IT architecture can deliver the outcomes their business are seeking in a way those who opt for traditional ERP upgrades or like-for-like system refactoring may not. Deloitte Consulting’s Deputy CTO Scott Radeztsky explains how XaaS can serve as a catalyst for business growth and innovation. 
 As consumer businesses invest in advanced technologies such as digital payment systems, cloud computing, and connected products, they may face increased cyber threats. CIOs and other C-suite executives can help their organizations prepare for and mitigate cyber risk by taking a more proactive role and developing an executive engagement playbook. 
 Many in the financial services industry expect technology—especially disruptive innovations such as blockchain and robotic process automation—to have an impact on the industry in the near term, according to a Deloitte Center for Financial Services analysis of a global survey of financial services executives. 
 Concerned by the growing prevalence of cyberattacks across industries, Texas Children’s Hospital launched a new, $60 million cybersecurity initiative two years ago. Today, it’s well on its way toward making the hospital’s operations secure, vigilant, and resilient. 
 New techniques for identifying and evaluating previously untapped information is empowering CIOs to provide business leaders with new insights. A comprehensive strategy aimed at analyzing this “dark data” could unearth new possibilities for understanding customers and improving products and services, among other benefits.
