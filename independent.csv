Robert Fisk This is the aim of Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia,"Security officials assured the writer that he was safe – when he was clearly still at great risk. And then, within hours, his blood was running down the steps of the Amman court
The survivors of this army, and their families will expect their sacrifice to be respected and, indeed, rewarded
Two officers tell me a creepy story, which might – given the nature of the Isis mind – have some pathetic truth. Several suicide bombers, they say, were found with women’s underclothes in their pockets, for the virgins they would meet in paradise
It is about taming the one Gulf nation which has the potential to outshine the Saudi kingdom and dictate the outcome of the Syria war
Exclusive: Documents recovered from a 'Sharia' court in the town of Deir Hafar show even minor disputes were brought before religious judges

In April, I entered Deir Hafer. Isis had just fled for their lives, leaving their infamous black flags, crucifixion posts, arms factories and black-painted Islamic courtrooms still intact. And yet Washington still maintains that the Syrians don’t fight Isis
Despite claiming he wouldn’t give a lecture, the President did just that, displaying a blatant anti-Iran bias intended to appease the nation with whom he’d just signed a multi-billion dollar arms deal at the expense of the truth
The Saudis will be appalled that a (comparatively) reasonable Iranian has won a (comparatively) free election that almost none of the 50 dictators gathering to meet Trump in Riyadh would ever dare to hold
Exclusive: For the Pentagon to suggest that this was a sideshow to Washington’s battle against Isis was to stretch the truth beyond credibility
The Sunni Saudis and the Gulf kings possess immense wealth, the only religion that Trump really respects, and they want to destroy Shia Iran, Syria, the Hezbollah and the Houthis – which is a simple ‘anti-terrorist’ story for the Americans
