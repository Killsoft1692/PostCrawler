Donald Trump insists 'blame on all sides' and 'alt-left' counter-protesters played role in sparking violence. But is he right? Fact-checking the President
A roundup of some of the most popular, but completely untrue, headlines of the week. None of these stories are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked these out; here are the real facts:

The survivors of this army, and their families will expect their sacrifice to be respected and, indeed, rewarded
Two officers tell me a creepy story, which might – given the nature of the Isis mind – have some pathetic truth. Several suicide bombers, they say, were found with women’s underclothes in their pockets, for the virgins they would meet in paradise
It is about taming the one Gulf nation which has the potential to outshine the Saudi kingdom and dictate the outcome of the Syria war
Exclusive: Documents recovered from a 'Sharia' court in the town of Deir Hafar show even minor disputes were brought before religious judges
While lives are lost every day, it is destruction of cities and monuments that drives home the vicious nature of conflict throughout history
If Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman can rush into a hopeless war with the Houthis of Yemen, why shouldn’t he threaten the body politic of Qatar?
Analysis: Tiny emirate has found who its real friends are after it was so casually abandoned by US President. But in Qatari business circles, there are fears the move was not so casual after all
Only Shakespeare’s plays could come close to describing such treachery – the comedies, that is
The Prime Minister is going to have her ‘embarrassing conversations’ with Britain’s Muslims, who have no power to switch off the evil ideology which Wahhabism represents. She does have that power – but she won’t use it
In April, I entered Deir Hafer. Isis had just fled for their lives, leaving their infamous black flags, crucifixion posts, arms factories and black-painted Islamic courtrooms still intact. And yet Washington still maintains that the Syrians don’t fight Isis
Despite claiming he wouldn’t give a lecture, the President did just that, displaying a blatant anti-Iran bias intended to appease the nation with whom he’d just signed a multi-billion dollar arms deal at the expense of the truth
The Saudis will be appalled that a (comparatively) reasonable Iranian has won a (comparatively) free election that almost none of the 50 dictators gathering to meet Trump in Riyadh would ever dare to hold
Exclusive: For the Pentagon to suggest that this was a sideshow to Washington’s battle against Isis was to stretch the truth beyond credibility
The Sunni Saudis and the Gulf kings possess immense wealth, the only religion that Trump really respects, and they want to destroy Shia Iran, Syria, the Hezbollah and the Houthis – which is a simple ‘anti-terrorist’ story for the Americans

Ben Stokes against Chris Gayle will provide a fascinating sub-plot to the five-match series between England and the West Indies
Essex had to wait for second-placed Lancashire's failure to win away to Somerset to be confirmed before they could start celebrating the silverware
The county is on the verge of its first title in 25 years, just a year after promotion, and it now looks perfectly primed for the future
Broad will rest the injury, which is thought to date back to problems with a split fat-pad in 2012/13, until England's departure for Australia at the end of October
The country is now the fastest growing in the cricket world and, if you remove the Netherlands from the equation, it now has more regular players than the rest of continental Europe combined

Ottis Gibson's departure from the England set-up to take over as South Africa's head coach leaves England need a new seam specialist ahead of the upcoming tour to Australia 
Bringing in anyone new for the Ashes is a non-starter and going back to players who have previously failed such as Gary Ballance and Keaton Jennings is also an unattractive proposition
The Lancashire paceman claimed his 500th wicket on a gloomy day at Lord's, leaving the Windies just 22 runs ahead with seven wickets remaining
The Lancastrian is the first England player to do so and follows in the footsteps of greats including Courtney Walsh, Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne
Stokes hijacked James Anderson's headlines with career-best figures as West Indies were bowled out for 123 - but the visitors refused to roll over as England were left 46 for four on the first day

Stephens, whose previous best run at a Grand Slam had been when she reached the semi-finals of the 2013 Australian Open, said the size of her winners cheque had come as a surprise
Hingis has been reluctant to make any long-term commitment, despite claiming two Grand Slam titles with Murray this summer
After overcoming injury in 2016, the South African is both physically and mentally ready for the challenge poised by a player he describes as one of the game's true greats
Sunday's final will be debutant vs old-timer, but there's a lot more to it than that

The Spaniard had to fight back to beat Argentina's Leonardo Mayer in the third round, while Federer made light work of Feliciano Lopez

Editorials

","Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia, sincerely or not, has offered 'unconditional dialogue' with his counterpart, and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would be wise to accept the offer 
The Cabinet Disunity Show has now gone on tour, with Theresa May commenting on the plane to Ottawa that ‘Boris is Boris’
Theresa May is right to say she will redouble official efforts to fight extremism, yet Donald Trump chose to be at his offensive worst
It would have been quite wrong to have repeated the chaotic process when the Government tried and successively failed to appoint a suitable chair of the inquiry into VIP child sex abuse. The Grenfell inquiry needs to get on with the job
The truth is that, as with much other crime, there is little that the authorities can do without the understanding and active support of the public
A government in such a precarious political position, not least over Brexit, cannot possibly risk a prolonged wave of strikes on public services as winter draws in
The EU never had unrestricted, unconditional free movement of people. There have always been rules about finding work and not being a threat to public policy, and some 5,000 EU citizens are denied entry or deported on this basis every year
The votes by the people of Scotland and Northern Ireland to stay in the EU ought not to be brushed aside by the tyranny of the English (and Welsh) majority
As is becoming increasingly clear, the real consequences of leaving the EU are turning out to be radically different to those vaguely supposed during the referendum campaign
The Scottish people would, on balance, like their politicians to stop banging on about independence, and to get on with fixing Scotland’s schools, which have shown an alarming slide in basic standards
The British continue to fatally overestimate their bargaining power and underestimate, just as fatally, the malign immediate consequences of a chaotic hard Brexit
What has changed in the past year is that the rapid refinement of North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes has coincided with the election to the American presidency of the most unpredictable character to ever hold the office
Who’d want to be British prime minister after the humiliation and the sharp recession that will arrive in 2019?
Without solid support in Scotland it is almost impossible for Labour to win a general election
Conservative MPs will come under enormous pressure not to vote with opposition parties to stay in the single market and customs union. But they should act in the national interest, even if the Prime Minister does not 
As Hurricane Harvey whirled into Texas and America held its breath for literal breaking news, the President got on with the business of confirming yet again his unfitness for office
If the European Court judges that the British version of their rules isn’t compatible with European law it could affect the ability of British people to operate in Europe, or British-based enterprises to export to Europe 
Trump may now find himself attacked by former allies, such as the Breitbart organisation, but he won’t mind that too much. Where, Trump may wonder, can they go politically if they drop their support for him? The Democrats?
The reason why the Irish border issue hasn’t been sorted out more than a year after the Brexit referendum is that it cannot logically be the same as it is now 
While ministers believe 'the money' is their trump card, the EU may have a bigger one: the clock
Although the anniversary of India and Pakistan's independence from Britain has inevitably recalled the terrible events which followed partition, it should also remind the two countries’ politicians that the common bonds between their people go much deeper than their love of cricket

You're gonna live longer, which means you're going to have to find a way to have more money
The proposed flat rate of relief would have to be funded by higher earners. And that creates a loophole that the Chancellor may plug, says Simon Read
Successive governments have left out in the cold elderly war heroes and other British citizens retiring to mainly former Commonwealth countries
Almost 5,000 firms failed to meet auto-enrolment deadlines while those who work for themselves are turning their back on pensions
George Osborne promised the bonds would provide ""certainty and comfort"" for over-65s, but the certainty turned out to be short-lived as, from the end of this month, the interest paid almost halves
Pension funds urge Britain's biggest carbon polluters to come clean over financial crisis that lies ahead
There's a place for cuddly characters in public information, says Gillian Orr, but it's not pension reform
One partial solution would be for employers to do more, especially as the pension auto-enrolment programme rolls out
Nearly two-thirds of people aged over 45 haven't checked the performance of their pension, meaning around 10 million retirement savings schemes are at risk of underperforming

Uber London ban: Ride hailing app private hire licence will not be renewed after 30 September,"TfL said Uber's approach and conduct 'demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications'
Transport for London on Friday announced that it was not renewing Uber’s licence to operate in the city dealing a sharp blow to the ride hailing app, tens of thousands of UK-based drivers and a sprawling customer base. 
In a damning statement, the transport authority said that its regulation of London's taxi and private hire trades is designed to ensure passenger safety. 
It said that private hire operators must meet rigorous regulations and that it had concluded that ""Uber London Limited is not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence"".
TfL said that it considers that Uber's approach and conduct “demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications”.
Its concerns relate to Uber’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and its approach to how medical certificates are obtained, among other things. 
The current licence expires on 30 September. Uber can appeal the decision within 21 days and will be able to continue to operate until that appeal process has been exhausted.
The California-based company, that was founded just over eight years ago, has been under intense fire from a growing army of critics in the UK, who claim that it is unfairly skewing competition and that it has not done enough to crack down on incidents of violence involving its drivers. 
The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, which has been one of the most vocal critics of Uber in London, praised Friday's decision and said that TfL had put public safety first.
“Since it first came onto our streets Uber has broken the law, exploited its drivers and refused to take responsibility for the safety of passengers,” Steve McNamara, the General Secretary of the LTDA said.
“We expect Uber will again embark on a spurious legal challenge against the Mayor and TfL, and we will urge the court to uphold this decision. This immoral company has no place on London’s streets”.
The GMB Union dubbed the move as a “historic victory”.
“As a result of sustained pressure from drivers and the public, Uber has suffered yet another defeat - losing its license to operate in London,” Maria Ludkin, GMB’s legal director said.
“No company can be behave like it's above the law, and that includes Uber. No doubt other major cities will be looking at this decision and considering Uber’s future on their own streets,” she added. 
London is one of Uber's most established markets and Friday’s decision comes at a critical time for the group. It could also embolden regulators in other countries to take a fiercer stand against the group. Uber is already battling a slew of legal cases and challenges in several US states and has been forced to quit countries including Denmark and Hungary.
In June, founder Travis Kananick resigned as from his role as chief executive officer in the face of shareholder outrage over company culture.
Responding to Friday’s decision, Tom Elvidge, general manager of Uber in London, said that drivers and clients would be “astounded”.
“By wanting to ban our app from the capital Transport for London and the Mayor have caved in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice. If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport,” he said.
“To defend the livelihoods of all those drivers, and the consumer choice of millions of Londoners who use our app, we intend to immediately challenge this in the courts.”
He said that drivers who use Uber are licensed by TfL and have been through the same background checks as black cab drivers.
“We have always followed TfL rules on reporting serious incidents and have a dedicated team who work closely with the Metropolitan Police.”
He said that Uber operates in more than 600 cities around the world, including more than 40 towns and cities here in the UK. This ban, Mr Elvidge said, ""would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies who bring choice to consumers”.
One of TfL's concerns relates to Uber's use of secret software known as ""greyball"". The company built it to avoid regulators. Uber on Friday said that ""greyball"" had never been used or considered in the UK for the purposes cited by TfL.
Dan Lewis, senior infrastructure adviser at the Institute of Directors, also said that it was important to consider the implications of shutting down Uber for London as a metropolitan city.
It urged Uber to clarify how it will meet the standards outlined by the regulator but also demanded that TfL pay heed to London’s “hard-fought and positive reputation as a hotbed for disruptive innovation and tech-driven competition”.
“Regulatory hurdles should not be an insurmountable barrier to allowing consumers to use products if they find them useful,” he said.
With 40,000 jobs at stake, he raised concerns about the human cost of the decision.
“TfL and Uber must come together to find a way through this because the bottom line is that competition driven by consumer choice is the cornerstone of the UK’s future economic success.”
Gett works in much the same way as Uber, but without the surge pricing, and is available on both iOS and Android. As well as London, you can also use it in Birmingham, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle.
MyTaxi, better known as Hailo to many, has already responded to the news by offering 50 per cent off fares. You can also save £10 on your first trip with the code 'myfirstmytaxi'. It's available on both iOS and Android.
Addison Lee has been around for years, and made huge changes to its service in order to keep up with Uber. Unfortunately, it's widely regarded as a rather expensive alternative. It's also available on both iOS and Android, though you can make bookings on the web too.
Kabbee also offers fixed prices, and claims its minicabs are 65 per cent cheaper than traditional black cabs. It's available on both iOS and Android.
Taxify launched in London earlier this month, but had to suspend operations within days. It will be thrilled with the timing of TfL’s announcement, but has a battle of its own in its hands if it's to start operating in the capital again. As well as paying for rides through the app, you can also use cash or a credit or debit card. It’s available on both iOS and Android.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan was among the supporters of the decision.
“All companies in London must play by the rules and adhere to the high standards we expect - particularly when it comes to the safety of customers,” he said. “It would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners’ safety and security.”
Senior MP Frank Field, who submitted a report to TfL in December 2016 calling on them not to renew Uber’s licence without first insisting on improvements in the company’s business model, said that the decision “could be a game changer for the gig economy”. 
Wes Streeting MP, Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Taxis, called TfL’s decision ""courageous” and said that it shows that “no company, however big and powerful, will be allowed to flout our laws and regulations or jeopardise Londoner's safety without facing serious consequences”.
“Uber has not shown itself to be a fit and proper operator. It stands accused by the Police of failing to properly handle serious allegations of rape and sexual assault of passengers. It had to be dragged through the courts to recognise its responsibility to provide even the most basic rights and protections to Uber drivers,” he said.
Smaller rival private hire operators welcomed the news too. 
One called mytaxi, launched an instant promotion offering half-price rides ""to undercut Uber on news that they are not fit and proper to operate"".
“We believe that Uber’s business model is based on pumping large amounts of private equity money into maintaining artificially low prices in an attempt to drive out competition, in preparation for raising prices once it has gained a monopoly role in the market,” mytaxi’s UK general manager, Andy Batty, said.

Uber ban: Can I still get a taxi in London through the app now that it has lost its licence?,"The situation remains largely unclear, and it's not certain what's happening to drivers or riders. But if the decision stands, you'll be banned from ever getting an Uber in London very soon
Uber has been banned in London, and cars are about to start disappearing
Transport for London announced that Uber would not be issued with a new licence after it expires next week. Theoretically, that means you won't be able to call an Uber, when its current licence expires on 30 September.
But the ruling also allows the opportunity for an appeal, and makes clear that Uber will be able to continue to operate while that process is ongoing. That appeal period will continue until mid-October, when Uber will either disappear entirely in London or have the decision reversed.

Everyone in the capital will be banned from taking a journey with the company because TfL judged it ""not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence"".
The company said it had made the decision based on a ""number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications"". They include its approach to serious ciminal offences, its approach to ""how medical certificates are obtained"" and the way that it hid itself from regulators, TfL said.
It also said the company will have 21 days to appeal the ruling from the time it is given – giving it until 13 October. It can ""continue to operate until any appeal processes have been exhausted"", it said, but it wasn't clear whether that applied only to the company or to its licence to operate as well.
Uber confirmed that it will appeal the decision.
It's also not clear what will happen to the tens of thousands of drivers and taxis that operate under the Uber name.
Uber said in a statement that the decision would ""show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies"".
Confirming Uber would appeal against the decision in court, Tom Elvidge, the firm's general manager in London, said: ""3.5 million Londoners who use our app, and more than 40,000 licensed drivers who rely on Uber to make a living, will be astounded by this decision.
""By wanting to ban our app from the capital Transport for London and the Mayor have caved in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice. If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport.
""To defend the livelihoods of all those drivers, and the consumer choice of millions of Londoners who use our app, we intend to immediately challenge this in the courts.
""Drivers who use Uber are licensed by Transport for London and have been through the same enhanced DBS background checks as black cab drivers. Our pioneering technology has gone further to enhance safety with every trip tracked and recorded by GPS.
""We have always followed TfL rules on reporting serious incidents and have a dedicated team who work closely with the Metropolitan Police.""
He added: ""Uber operates in more than 600 cities around the world, including more than 40 towns and cities here in the UK. This ban would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies who bring choice to consumers.""

Uber London ban: Sadiq Khan and TFL’s statement in full after ride-hailing app’s licence not renewed,"Uber will not be issued with an operating licence after its current deal expires on September 30, Transport for London (TfL) has announced.
TfL concluded that the minicab app is ""not fit and proper"" to operate in the capital due to concerns which have ""public safety and security implications"".
These include its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and how it carries out background checks on its drivers.
TfL's full statement is as follows:
""Transport for London (TfL) has today informed Uber London Limited that it will not be issued with a private hire operator licence after expiry of its current licence on 30 September.
""TfL's regulation of London's taxi and private hire trades is designed to ensure passenger safety. Private hire operators must meet rigorous regulations, and demonstrate to TfL that they do so, in order to operate. TfL must also be satisfied that an operator is fit and proper to hold a licence. 
""TfL has concludeed that Uber London Limited is not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence.
""TfL considers that Uber's approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications. These include:
Its approach to explaining the use of Greyball in London, software that could be used to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app and prevent officials from undertaking regulatory or law enforcement duties. 
""The Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 includes provision to appeal a licencing decision within 21 days of it being communicated to the applicant. Uber London Limited can continue to operate until any appeal processes have been exhausted. 
""No further comment will be made by TfL pending any appeal of this decision.""

Uber ban: Ride hailing firm says TfL has 'shown the world that London is closed to innovative companies',"The company says the decision 'will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport'.
Uber has responded to Transport for London's announcement that it will not renew the company's licence to operate in the UK capital.
In a statement, Uber said that banning its operations in London would, ""show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies who bring choice to consumers.” Uber vowed to challenge the ruling. It has 21 days to lodge an appeal.
Tom Elvidge, general manager of Uber in London, said: “3.5 million Londoners who use our app, and more than 40,000 licensed drivers who rely on Uber to make a living, will be astounded by this decision.
“By wanting to ban our app from the capital Transport for London and the Mayor have caved in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice. If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport.
“To defend the livelihoods of all those drivers, and the consumer choice of millions of Londoners who use our app, we intend to immediately challenge this in the courts.
“Drivers who use Uber are licensed by Transport for London and have been through the same enhanced DBS background checks as black cab drivers.""
Uber argued that its technology enhances rather than reduces safety. It said it had always followed TfL rules on reporting serious incidents and worked closely with the Metropolitan Police.
""As we have already told TfL, an independent review has found that ‘greyball’ has never been used or considered in the UK for the purposes cited by TfL,"" Mr Elvidge added.
Greyball is a controversial technology Uber used in the US that allowed it to operate in markets where it was not licensed by identifying and avoiding local officials. TfL cited it is as one of the reasons for not renewing Uber's licence, along with the company's approach to reporting criminal offences and obtaining medical certificates and obtaining criminal records checks.
The transport authority announced on Friday that it was not renewing Uber’s licence to operate in London, dealing a sharp blow to the ride hailing app, tens of thousands of UK-based drivers and a sprawling customer base. Uber's current licence runs out on 30 September but the company will allowed to continue to operate until the appeals process is concluded.
In a damning statement, the transport authority said that its regulation of London's taxi and private hire trades is designed to ensure passenger safety. 
Private hire operators must meet rigorous regulations, and demonstrate that they do so, in order to operate, it said.  It also said that it must be satisfied that an operator is fit and proper to hold a licence.
TfL concluded that Uber does not meet these criteria.
Gett works in much the same way as Uber, but without the surge pricing, and is available on both iOS and Android. As well as London, you can also use it in Birmingham, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle.
MyTaxi, better known as Hailo to many, has already responded to the news by offering 50 per cent off fares. You can also save £10 on your first trip with the code 'myfirstmytaxi'. It's available on both iOS and Android.
Addison Lee has been around for years, and made huge changes to its service in order to keep up with Uber. Unfortunately, it's widely regarded as a rather expensive alternative. It's also available on both iOS and Android, though you can make bookings on the web too.
Kabbee also offers fixed prices, and claims its minicabs are 65 per cent cheaper than traditional black cabs. It's available on both iOS and Android.
Taxify launched in London earlier this month, but had to suspend operations within days. It will be thrilled with the timing of TfL’s announcement, but has a battle of its own in its hands if it's to start operating in the capital again. As well as paying for rides through the app, you can also use cash or a credit or debit card. It’s available on both iOS and Android.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan countered Uber's accusation that the capital was closed to innovative businesses.
Responding to TfL's announcement on Friday, he said: “I want London to be at the forefront of innovation and new technology and to be a natural home for exciting new companies that help Londoners by providing a better and more affordable service. 
“However, all companies in London must play by the rules and adhere to the high standard we expect – particularly when it comes to the safety of customers. Providing an innovative service must not be at the expense of customer safety and security.
“I fully support TfL’s decision - it would be wrong if TfL continued to licence Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners’ safety and security. Any operators or private hire services in London need to play by the rules.""

North Korea: Donald Trump vows to test 'madman' Kim Jong-un 'like never before',"Threat comes after North Korea suggested it might test a nuclear weapon in the Pacific Ocean
Donald Trump has called Kim Jong-un a ""madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people"", declaring the North Korean leader will be ""tested like never before"".
The declaration came in a tweet and followed a North Korean threat to detonate a nuclear weapon over the Pacific Ocean. 
Mr Trump's fiery speech at the United Nations earlier this week has served to ramp up the tensions between the two countries. 
Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!
The tweet was sent shortly before 4am in Washington, DC time. 
Shortly after making the announcement, Mr Trump re-tweeted a number of messages complimenting his controversial UN performance. 
Echoing previous comments, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson then said diplomatic efforts with North Korea would continue but the US was open to using military options. 
Relations between the US and North Korea have significantly deteriorated in recent months, with the two leaders stooping to trading personal insults. 
Earlier, Mr Kim called Mr Trump a ""mentally deranged US dotard', meaning a senile elderly person. He threatened to ""tame"" Mr Trump with ""fire"".
Conversely, the US President has taken to calling Mr Kim 'Rocket Man', apparently after his tendency to test fire missiles against international rules.

Mr Trump has used much more severe rhetoric than his predecessors against the rogue state. In August, he threatened ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" against North Korea, if it endangered US interests. 
China, North Korea's closest ally, has called for restraint between the two parties.

Pair charged with murder after nanny's burned body found in South London garden,"Victim named locally as 21-year-old who had been working and living with couple
A man and a woman have been charged with murder after a burned body was discovered at their home in Southfields, South West London. 
Police arrived at the address on Wimbledon Park Road after reports of a fire. A body was found at the scene, but it was too badly burned to establish the gender or the age.
They have now charged Ouissem Medouni, 40 and Sabrina Kouider, 34, with murder.
Still cordoned off this morning 😕@davidprice33 #Southfields #sw18 pic.twitter.com/xhPjsAxLxU
The victim has been named locally as Sophie Lionnet, 21, from France, who had been working for the couple as a live-in nanny. 
Ms Kouider, who is now working as a stylist and make-up artist, is the ex-girlfriend of former Boyzone member Mark Walton, it has emerged. 
Mr Walton had a son with the suspect, one of two children Ms Lionnet was engaged to look after, according to a Daily Mail report. 
A neighbour told The Evening Standard her children saw a man poking what they thought were “sticks” onto a bonfire in the garden on Wednesday evening.
“My little boys looked over and saw this man sweeping some wood into the burning stuff. He told me it was just a ‘big pile of black’.
“I didn’t think much of it they did odd things at odd times anyway. I only ever really saw the French nanny and the kids.”
Detective Inspector Richard Leonard, from the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ""A post-mortem examination will establish how they died. Early indications are that attempts were made to dispose of the body.
""I would like to appeal to those in and around the area to come forward with information. You may well have seen or heard something suspicious in the last few days which could assist our investigators.""
Superintendent Peter Gardner, from Wandsworth Police, said: ""I fully appreciate the concern that this investigation will cause in the local community.
""Specialist investigators will be carrying out work at the scene whilst local neighbourhood officers will be patrolling in and around the area to help reassure residents and, where possible, respond to their concerns.""
 The pair will appear at Wimbledon Magistrates Court on Friday.

A serving Metropolitan Police officer has been accused of sexual offences against children.
PC Daniel Cooper, 31, works in the specialist crime and operations unit of the UK’s largest police force.
The alleged paedophile has been charged with 16 offences namely - four of gross indecency, four of indecent assault, two of sexually touching a child, five of possessing indecent images and one of sexual activity in front of a child.
“PC Cooper was not on duty at the time of the alleged offences,” a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said. “PC Cooper is suspended from duty.”
A spokesperson said he was charged by officers from Scotland Yard’s child abuse and sexual offences command and is due to appear at Bromley Magistrates’ Court on 19 October.

"Tintin is a girl and 'probably asexual', French philosopher claims","Blistering barnacles! Vincent Cespedes says he stumbled on the idea when re-reading the comic book series to his children
A French philosopher has claimed that beloved comic book character Tintin was in fact a girl, and ""probably asexual"".
Vincent Cespedes, who is also a painter, pianist and composer, is the author of essays on a number of subjects, and is causing a stir in the comic book world after announcing that the teenage reporter/detective is a girl - and Belgian creator Hergé and his friends were in on the joke. 
The 44-year-old writes that the farce is ""so enormous"" that ""the most cherished of the tintinophilies [Tintin fans], from the philosopher Jean-Luc Marion to the filmmaker Steven Spielberg, have not even detected it"".
Cespedes says Tintin is ""an androgynous redhead with blue eyes"" and ""presumably asexual"". He stumbled upon the idea when reading the books with his children. 
""I had just finished a book by Raymond Ruyer which shows that Homer is a woman, I had some sort of software in my head when I got back into Tintin and it immediately seemed obvious to me,"" he told French Huffington Post. 
While he admits that there are few clues in Tintin's physical appearance, he says certain mannerisms, along with Tintin's ""long history of dealing with gender issues"", all pointed towards Tintin being a woman. 
Cespedes says Tintin would have been disguised as a boy to allow him/her to travel ""without fear of the misogyny of other cultures, modesty, manners, or the stupidity of prejudices"".
When a villain accidentally smashed his fist on the wall in The Temple of the Sun, Tintin said ""sorry"". Tintin's attitude towards Captain Haddock when he was drunk in The Crab With The Golden Claws showed traits that would be interpreted as stereotypically feminine when Hergé was alive. 
Cespedes claims that there are also several instances in the comic series where Tintin dresses in skirts or other items of female clothing when it is not necessary. 
On his social media accounts, Cespedes claimed that in 1991, French actress Juliette Binoche played the role of the teenager. Several people said that this was in fact Judith Godrèche, but did not dispute that a woman had taken on the role in the past.
Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Hergé, was born in 1907 and is best known for his comic series The Adventures of Tintin, which have been the source of a range of adaptations in TV, film, radio and theatre.
Most recently, Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg starred in the 2011 performance capture film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson.

Florence Speech protest: Anti-Brexit activists rally against Theresa May,"Florentines mostly uninterested in PM's visit
A small but extremely enthusiastic band of anti-Brexit protesters are assembled outside the Santa Maria Novella church in Florence ahead of Theresa May’s speech – some waving placards with demonic-looking pictures of the PM on them.
“Denied a vote: Denied a voice,” one sign reads, waved by a British national living in Italy – one of thousands whose future in their adoptive country was plunged into uncertainty since a referendum they had no vote in. 
Apart from the EU flag, Ms May’s face is the most omnipresent image displayed in the notably calm crowd, illustrating the extent to which the once Remain-supporting PM has personalised Brexit as an issue and staked her reputation on it.
Apart from the protesters – and the usual media circus of satellite vans, photographers, and reporters in Piazza di Santa Maria Novella – very few locals seems all that interested in Ms May’s speech. Much like the Brussels officials the address’s content is aimed at, they are mostly staying away, probably because they’re not really invited. A woman at the city’s station tourist office is aware the speech is happening, but declines to express a view on the Prime Minister. 
Santa Maria Novella, a 13th century Gothic-renaissance church straight out of a hastily-bought postcard, is beautiful in the cool September sun – which unlike the denizens of Westminster, lucky Florentines are still enjoying. A plaque on the square out the front advertises the fact the area has been restored using EU money.
The church is home to a number of notable artworks by Renaissance artists including Bittichelli, Masaccio, and Giotto. It is also notable as the site of one of the first denunciations of Galileo, who claimed the earth moves around the sun. Once a heresy, that idea is now widely accepted.
Since the location of the Prime Minister’s speech was announced, a number of people have expressed confusion about why it is being held in Florence. Officially, Downing Street likes to highlight the Renaissance city’s trading links with Britain stretching back to the Middle Ages. Hosting the speech abroad also gives it an extra air of gravitas that it might not achieve at home.
Meanwhile, irreverent jokers have suggested that Florence, a once-important banking centre that gradually faded into commercial irrelevance, is the perfect place for a speech about Brexit. Santa Maria Novella – whose adjoined chapter house specialsies in ornate funerary monuments, is also an inspired choice. 
More charitably, the city chosen by the Prime Minister is notable as the site of the 1439 Council of Florence, which sought to end the Great Schism of the eastern and western churches.  Though years of talks ended with an agreement being signed, it was never actually implemented.

Theresa May Florence speech- live updates: UK PM sets out her Brexit vision after weeks of Tory Cabinet splits,"Theresa May will tell European counterparts their shared political legacies depend on agreeing a good Brexit deal as she seeks to break the deadlock in negotiations over the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Prime Minister will set out her plans for a transitional period from the formal date of Brexit in March 2019, expected to last two years, before moving to a permanent trade deal.
Ms May is thought to be considering an offer of paying around 20 billion euro (£17.6 billion) over the transition period in order to secure favourable trading arrangements, which would also help address Brussels' concerns about the potential hole in its current budget caused by the UK's exit.
Scroll down for The Independent's live blog.
And she is also reported to be ready to give ground on the issue of citizens' rights for EU nationals in the UK, enshrining the terms of any deal in a formal treaty.
Her landmark speech comes as an opinion poll suggested a majority of Britons now back staying in the European Union - with 52% in favour of remaining part of the bloc.
In the Italian city of Florence, Ms May will say European leaders they have a ""profound sense of responsibility"" to agree good terms.
Her direct pitch to the continent's leaders will be seen as a further attempt to try to bypass the formal talks led by Brussels' Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier, which have stalled amid concerns of a lack of progress on the financial settlement, citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border.
Ms May will emphasise the historic nature of the negotiations as she calls for an ""imaginative and creative"" approach to securing a deal, in what may be seen as a fresh British complaint about the European Commission's perceived rigid approach to talks.
But Ms May - who has repeatedly vowed that she would walk away with no deal rather than accept a ""bad deal"" from Brussels - will also stress that the UK has ""considerable"" fundamental economic strengths and an ""indomitable spirit"".
The Prime Minister will say that if a deal can be reached ""then when this chapter of our European history is written, it will be remembered not for the differences we faced, but for the vision we showed"" and ""not for a relationship that ended but a new partnership that began"".
She will acknowledge that Brexit is ""inevitably a difficult process"" but it is in ""all of our interests for our negotiations to succeed"".
""I believe we share a profound sense of responsibility to make this change work smoothly and sensibly, not just for people today but for the next generation who will inherit the world we leave them,"" she will say.
""The eyes of the world are on us but if we can be imaginative and creative about the way we establish this new relationship ... I believe we can be optimistic about the future we can build for the United Kingdom and for the European Union.""
The Prime Minister's speech, which will build on the Brexit plans she set out in Lancaster House in January, will set out her vision for a ""bold"" economic and security partnership.
But she is thought to have rejected a Swiss-style ""European Economic Area minus"" deal, which could have involved ongoing payments to Brussels and potentially accepting the free movement of people.
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, whose intervention on Brexit last week led to speculation he might be about to resign, was opposed to any continued payments for single market access after the transitional period expires.
After a marathon two-and-half hour session of the Cabinet on Thursday, Mr Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond - who have been at loggerheads all summer over Brexit - left No 10 together in an apparent show of unity.
The BBC reported that Ms May was prepared to pay 20 billion euro over the period of the transition - a far lower figure than Brussels is thought to want.
Ms May will also seek to end the impasse on citizens' rights, with the Financial Times reporting that the terms of an agreement would be written into a Brexit treaty rather than in legislation which MPs could seek to water down.
British officials have told negotiators they are considering whether future European Court of Justice rulings on citizens' rights should be taken into account by UK judges, the newspaper reported.
In an optimistic message about the strength of the UK, the Prime Minister will use her speech to insist that ""Britain's future is bright"".
""Our fundamental strengths are considerable,"" she will say, including ""a legal system respected around the world; a keen openness to foreign investment; and enthusiasm for innovation; an ease of doing business; some of the best universities and researchers you can find anywhere; an exceptional national talent for creativity; and an indomitable spirit"".
On the eve of Ms May's speech, Mr Barnier issued a fresh warning that Britain must ""settle the accounts"" if it wants a free trade deal when it leaves the bloc.
Mr Barnier said there was still ""major uncertainty"" over the UK's approach on key issues and a ""question of trust"" about the financial settlement.
Ms May's speech comes as a BMG Research poll for the Independent indicated a reverse in support for Brexit.
In a mirror image of the June 2016 referendum result, 52% supported remaining in the EU with 48% in favour of leaving.

Brexit speech: Chris Grayling signals UK could continue paying money to EU to settle 'long term' costs,"Chris Grayling did not rule out the possibility of 'contributions in the future'
The UK could end up paying into EU coffers for ""long term obligations"" in order to secure a Brexit deal, a cabinet minister has indicated.
Chris Grayling did not rule out the possibility of continuing to pay to settle the costs of long term liabilities such as the pensions of EU officials working in Brussels.
It comes after Theresa May managed to seal a cabinet truce ahead of her speech in Florence today, which erupted with Boris Johnson demanding that the UK not make long term cash contributions to the EU.
In Italy the Prime Minister will promise to settle the UK’s financial obligations, in the hope that it will persuade EU leaders to agree to start talking about trade.
But while her officials have said the UK will ensure no hole opens in the EU budget up to 2020 – meaning a pay-out of some £20bn – Mr Grayling’s words leave the door open for a further reaching commitment.
Transport Secretary Mr Grayling was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, if there would be “contributions in the future, for example to meet long term obligations that the UK has for the pensions of EU officials”.

He responded: “We’ve been very open all the way through in saying we are a nation that meets its obligations, that’s going to be the case, it is the case there’s never been any doubt about that.”
Sources indicate Ms May’s speech will point to a transition period of two years, during which the UK would be willing to pay into EU coffers.
Although it is not thought she will state an actual figure, it has been reported she is willing to pay between £20bn and £30bn into as the starting price of Britain’s withdrawal.
Ms May will try and find a new form of words to convince EU leaders the UK will meet its financial obligations, with UK officials having already briefed European capitals that Britain will ensure no hole in the EU budgets to 2020 and that no member state will receive less money, or pay more to Brussels, because of Brexit.
Relations between Ms May and Mr Johnson have been strained since the Foreign Secretary wrote a 4,000-word article in The Telegraph setting out his vision for Brexit, despite Ms May having already announced that she was to give a key speech on the EU.
Reports that he would quit if Ms May committed the UK to permanently paying for access to the EU’s single market were denied, but caused enough concern for the two to hold talks in the US ahead of the cabinet meeting.
More broadly Mr Grayling said Ms May would set out the “principles” of a future relationship with the bloc in the speech, but said the detail on immigration arrangements for EU citizens during a transition period would be worked out in negotiations.
He went on: “But it's in all of our interests that we migrate to our life outside the European Union in the best possible way for Britain and actually in the best possible way for our friends and neighbours across the Channel, that's the responsible thing to do.”

"Brexit: Majority of British people believe UK should stay in the EU, finds latest poll","Exclusive: The change of heart comes as Theresa May travels to Florence to make a major Brexit speech 
British people have turned their backs on Brexit, according to a new poll released just as Theresa May prepares to give a make-or-break speech on her plans for EU withdrawal.
The exclusive survey for The Independent by BMG Research shows a majority now believe the country should remain in the EU, after weeks in which deadlocked Brussels talks and cabinet splits exposed the sheer complexity of withdrawal.
Ms May goes to Florence in the hope of convincing EU leaders of the “importance of negotiations making further progress” with time running out before Britain falls out of the bloc without terms.
She outlined her speech to ministers on Thursday at a cabinet meeting that ended in a public display of unity, following reports that Brexiteers had planned to quit the front bench if Ms May dared to soften her stance.
The new poll of more than 1,400 UK adults showed 52 per cent of the public back remaining in the EU, while 48 per cent would support leaving.
The numbers are a mirror image of the June 2016 referendum result and a shift from the same poll conducted two months ago, which showed a clear 50/50 split.
Ms May’s speech is being seen as an attempt to persuade member state leaders that the UK is serious about paying its Brexit “divorce bill”, in the hope they will agree to start talking about a future trade deal.
A briefing released beforehand said how Ms May will be “expressing the importance of negotiations making further progress”, and she will “remind leaders that a successful final agreement is in the interest of both sides”.

She will say: “If we can do that, then when this chapter of our European history is written, it will be remembered not for the differences we faced, but for the vision we showed; not for the challenges we endured but for the creativity we used to overcome them; not for a relationship that ended but a new partnership that began.”
She will admit that “the UK’s departure from the EU is inevitably a difficult process” but will say leaders share “a profound sense of responsibility to make this change work smoothly and sensibly”.
Sources indicate Ms May’s speech will point to a transition period of two years, during which the UK would be willing to pay into EU coffers.
Although it is not thought she will state an actual figure, it has been reported she is willing to pay between £20bn and £30bn into as the starting price of Britain’s withdrawal.
Ms May will try and find a new form of words to convince EU leaders the UK will meet its financial obligations, with UK officials having already briefed European capitals that Britain will ensure no hole in the EU budgets to 2020 and that no member state will receive less money, or pay more to Brussels, because of Brexit.
The Independent also understands Ms May will steer clear of setting out expectations for access to the single market during the transition, a potentially divisive issue in her Cabinet that would have ramifications for immigration and free movement.
Nor will she elaborate on any long-term plan extending beyond the transition period that could tether the UK to European Economic Area regulation –  which would been seen by Brexiteers as incompatible with “taking back control”.
A key purpose of Thursday’s cabinet meeting was to unify warring factions ahead of the speech, in particular Brexiteers like Boris Johnson demanding a clean break from the EU, and moderates led by Philip Hammond who want as little disruption as possible to UK businesses.
The talks broke up after two and a half hours, with Ms May having reiterated that Britain must have a “bespoke” final deal unlike either a Canada-style free trade agreement or a tighter Norway-style association with the single market.
The broad-brush nature of the speech allowed Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke to emerge saying it is likely to enjoy the “backing of all of us”.
Recent weeks have seen an increasingly bitter cabinet row over the path that the UK takes, with Brexiteers fearing Mr Hammond and his supporters have gained too much ground.
The Chancellor has been pushing for a transition period with trade and customs arrangements as similar as possible to existing ones, but Leave backers see it as a precursor to tying the UK into paying money and adopting EU regulation for fuller access to the single market.
It came to a head earlier this week when Mr Johnson demanded the UK not pay for continued access to EU markets after Brexit. The Foreign Secretary was later forced to deny he was planning to resign, while Ms May faced calls to sack him.
The pair then spent the seven-hour flight home from the UN in New York together, allowing them to come to a consensus ahead of Thursday’s cabinet meeting.
In what appears to be a snub to the Prime Minister, no European Commission officials were expected to attend Ms May’s landmark speech.
She has made clear that it is the leaders of member states who will make the final decision over a Brexit deal, and the speech is being seen in Brussels as an attempt to bypass Commission negotiators.
The BMG poll involved 1,447 individuals surveyed between 12-15 September. Results are weighted to reflect the profile of GB adults

"Australian schoolgirl who killed herself after alleged gang rape unlikely to get justice, say authorities","Cassidy Trevan took her own life at the age of 15 after writing a letter about being gang-raped two years earlier
Five teenagers allegedly involved in the gang rape of a 13-year-old Australian girl, who killed herself two years later, may never be prosecuted, the state of Victoria's Victims of Crime Commissioner has said.
Cassidy Trevan revealed she had been raped by two boys at a house in a Melbourne suburb, while two girls who had bullied her waited in a nearby room and a third boy stood watch at the front door, in a heartbreaking letter released by her mother after her suicide.
In the letter, Cassidy said she had moved house and gone to a different school but still got “students I’ve never met contacting me Facebook calling me a slut”.
Her mother, Linda Trevan, has campaigned for police to reopen her daughter’s case in the hope of prosecuting the five teenagers allegedly involved.
But, speaking to Australia’s 9News, Greg Davies, the state of Victoria’s Victims of Crime Commissioner, said there was little chance of securing a conviction.
“I would think it would be almost unprecedented to have anyone convicted of a rape years after it had occurred and after the victim had passed away,” he said.
“There may be a very faint possibility that somebody could say ‘we did do it’. But you would need full and freely given admissions from one or more, together with medical evidence that may or may not exist.”
Mr Davies, a former police officer, expressed sympathy for Cassidy’s family.
“I cannot even imagine what they have gone through, it’s just the most horrible situation for a family to be in. Just horrendous,” he said.
“It’s pretty awful to sit back and think there are three males who are quite possibly rapists. And a couple of teenage girls – who are not five-year-olds and don’t know right from wrong – who are alleged to have created the circumstances in which this poor girl has been raped multiple times.
""If they get to walk away from it scot-free, there is very little justice. This is one of the most awful crimes that could happen to a female. And what is their attitude now? One assumes they have shown no remorse for anything they have done.”
Cassidy’s letter said she had been raped by pupils who were still studying at her previous school and that she had been taunted about what happened ever since.
She said she wanted to alert other pupils and their parents to the danger.
“I’m not doing this for revenge to those students that raped me, set up the rape, bullied me about the rape, teased me about the rape or anything like that. I’m also not doing this for attention seeking … I want to make that clear,” Cassidy wrote.
“I’m doing this because over 1,500 students, years 7-12, are currently enrolled at the school and they need to be warned.”
She added: “I can’t stop people from spreading rumours, but at least I could try and spread what really happened seeing as it’s still being talked about anyway. But, as I said, this honestly is more so for students who are unaware of this and are in danger of those students.
“My name is Cassidy Trevan, and I was raped.
“If anyone ever tries this on you, trust me it’s worth fighting! Fight! If you don’t you’ll regret it for the rest of your life like I do. You can do it.
“Be careful. Be warned. Be safe.”

There have been calls for protests to end to what campaigners call Brazil's 'culture of rape' after the attack
An online campaign has been set up in response to the crime, using the hashtag #EstuproNuncaMais, meaning 'rape never again'
The 16-year-old victim was attacked in a poor neighbourhood in the west of the city on 21 May 2016
Two of the attackers posted pictures and video on Twitter of the assault, which has shocked the country

While she met police officers several times about what happened, Cassidy did not make a formal statement for fear that retaliation by those involved would “push her over the edge”.
She took her life in December 2015.
While the police were told the names of the five teenagers, they were never interviewed, according to Cassidy’s mother.
“All I want is for them to be questioned. For them to not think they got away completely scot-free, no consequences. I want them to feel the fear that Cass felt,” Ms Trevan said.
“A 13-year-old girl can’t be gang raped and then end up suiciding from it and there be no consequences, no-one even questioned.”
She has appealed for the boy who acted as the lookout to come forward.
“I’ve been asked thousands of times to 'name and shame' the five kids, but I'm doing the right thing by not doing that,” Ms Trevan said.
""But they should do the right thing now and come forward themselves so they don't have to suffer the guilt for the rest of their lives.”

Russia threatens to retaliate against US forces in Syria,"'Fire points in those areas will be immediately suppressed with all military means' says Major-General Igor Konashenkov
Russia has threatened to target areas in Syria where American special forces and US-backed militia are operating if its own forces came under fire from them - something it said had already happened twice.
The country's defence ministry said Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting, had taken up positions on the eastern banks of the Euphrates alongside US special forces. 
The SDF had twice opened fire with mortars and artillery on Syrian troops who were working alongside Russian special forces, it claimed. 
Major-General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement that a representative of the US military command in Al Udeid, the American operations centre in Qatar, had been ""told in no uncertain terms that any attempts to open fire from areas where SDF fighters are located would be quickly shut down.""
He added: ""Fire points in those areas will be immediately suppressed with all military means.""
Moscow also claimed that the SDF had diverted from the battle to take the northern city Raqqa to the province of Deir al-Zor, around 100 miles to the east, where Russian special forces are helping the Syrian army push out Isis militants. 
In Deir al-Zor, the Islamic militants are battling two separate offensives, launched by the SDF on one side and the Syrian army and its allies on the other.
The Syrian army, backed by Russian and Syrian war planes, has captured about 62 miles of the west bank of the Euphrates this month, reaching the Raqqa provincial border earlier this week, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
Syrian troops also crossed to the eastern side of the river on Monday. The SDF's advances have been on the eastern bank of the river.
The convergence of the two rival offensives has increased tensions in Deir al-Zor. The US-backed militia said over the weekend that they had come under attack from Russian jets and Syrian government forces, something Moscow denied.

The SDF later warned against any further Syrian army advances on the eastern riverbank.
Russia's Defence Ministry subsequently said the waters of the Euphrates had risen as soon as the Syrian army began crossing it, suggesting this could only have happened if upstream dams held by the U.S.-backed opposition had been opened.
Major General Konashenkov, in his statement, questioned the nature of SDF's relationship with Issis. Russian drones did not detect any clashes between the two groups when SDF fighters approached Deir al-Zor, he said.

North Korea: Kim Jong-un's statement about 'deranged dotard' Donald Trump in full,"'A frightened dog barks louder'
North Korean state media released a rare personal statement from leader Kim Jong-un on Friday, in which he hit back at Donald Trump's threat to ""totally destroy"" his country. Here is the statement, released by KCNA in English to reach an international audience, in full:
""Pyongyang, September 22 (KCNA) - Respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK, released a statement on Thursday.
""The full text of the statement reads:
""The speech made by the US president in his maiden address on the UN arena in the prevailing serious circumstances, in which the situation on the Korean peninsula has been rendered tense as never before and is inching closer to a touch-and-go state, is arousing worldwide concern.
""Shaping the general idea of what he would say, I expected he would make stereo-typed, prepared remarks a little different from what he used to utter in his office on the spur of the moment as he had to speak on the world's biggest official diplomatic stage.
""But, far from making remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful to defusing tension, he made unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessors.
""A frightened dog barks louder.
""I'd like to advise Trump to exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the world.
""The mentally deranged behavior of the US president openly expressing on the UN arena the unethical will to ""totally destroy"" a sovereign state, beyond the boundary of threats of regime change or overturn of social system, makes even those with normal thinking faculty think about discretion and composure.
""His remarks remind me of such words as ""political layman"" and ""political heretic"" which were in vogue in reference to Trump during his presidential election campaign.
""After taking office Trump has rendered the world restless through threats and blackmail against all countries in the world. He is unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician.
""His remarks which described the US option through straightforward expression of his will have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last.
""Now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history that he would destroy the DPRK, we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding, highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history.
""Action is the best option in treating the dotard who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say.
""As a man representing the DPRK and on behalf of the dignity and honor of my state and people and on my own, I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the U.S. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the DPRK.

""This is not a rhetorical expression loved by Trump.
""I am now thinking hard about what response he could have expected when he allowed such eccentric words to trip off his tongue.
""Whatever Trump might have expected, he will face results beyond his expectation.
""I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.""

Grenfell Tower Fire: How did it happen?,"As criminal investigation and public inquiry take shape, reporter Lucy Pasha-Robinson goes over the key questions that need answering
It is 100 days since the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower fire that killed around 80 people.
The conditions that led to the fire involve local council disputes, outsourcing, building regulations – topics that can appear dry and inaccessible, but as the fire showed, without proper scrutiny, can lead to an absolutely devastating catastrophe. 
As the criminal investigation and independent public inquiry get under way, police investigating say they may press individual manslaughter charges, which could see those responsible for the disaster jailed.
Reporter Lucy Pasha-Robinson goes over the key questions that will be relevant to both the investigation and the inquiry.

Mexico earthquake death toll rises to 273 as rescue efforts continue,"Number to have perished in the country's worst quake for 32 years is expected to climb further as chances of survival diminish
The death toll in the Mexico City earthquake has risen to at least 273, officials have said.
The toll has continued to rise steadily since Tuesday's 7.1 magnitude quake, the second to strike the central American country in 11 days.
The country's President Enrique Pena Nieto has said he believes there could still be people trapped alive in ten buildings three days after the disaster, the worst quake to hit Mexico in 32 years.
Rescuers toiled on Thursday to pluck survivors, including Taiwanese workers, from collapsed buildings but the navy said no more children are left trapped in the school at the centre of the rescue operation.
But after more than a day of constant television coverage of the search for a girl in the rubble of the Enrique Rebsamen School in the south of the capital, the Mexican Navy changed its version of events and said all pupils are now accounted for.

Eleven other children were rescued from the school, where students are aged from 6 to 15. 
Nineteen children and six adults are believed to have died and the body of a woman was pulled from the rubble on Thursday morning.
With the chance of survival diminishing with each passing hour, officials vowed to press on, heartened by a few success stories.
Late on Wednesday night, an eight-year-old girl was rescued from a collapsed building in the Tlalpan neighbourhood, nearly 36 hours after the quake, local officials said.
The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed five nationals were trapped in a collapsed clothing factory in the Obrera neighbourhood. The victims included a Taiwanese businessman, according to Carlos Liao, Taiwan's top envoy to Mexico.
Rescue workers were joined by crews from Panama, El Salvador, the US and Israel with others from Latin American countries on the way.
Three days of national mourning have been declared for the disaster which struck on the anniversary of the 1986 quake that killed thousands.
The country was attempting to recover from another powerful quake less than a fortnight ago that killed more than 100 people in the south of the country.

Father 'strangled children and set house on fire before hanging himself' say police in Illinois,"Authorities in Bloomington, Illinois, say a 33-year-old man hid his family's cellphones, killed his two children and intentionally set a house fire before hanging himself.
Police on Wednesday identified the man as Eric Ringenberg. Officials identified the two boys only by their initials, 2-year-old CR and infant brother, RR.
The Pantagraph in Bloomington reports the mother, 32-year-old Pamela Ringenberg, was hospitalized for smoke inhalation after Tuesday morning's fire. Autopsies showed the children were strangled.
Police say home surveillance cameras show Eric Ringenberg putting the cellphones in a kitchen cabinet, then intentionally starting a fire in the basement after the children were killed.
The father then hanged himself.
The cameras also show Pamela Ringenberg awaking to the sound of the smoke alarm and searching for her family and cellphone. She eventually fled the home and sought help from neighbours.

Brexit: Jeremy Corbyn mocks 'disarray' at heart of Theresa May's Government,"Labour leader says party is ready for another election after June's vote 'changed politics'
Jeremy Corbyn has mocked ""disarray"" at the heart of Theresa May's Government as he proclaimed that Labour was the party of the mainstream.
The Labour leader said the row over Boris Johnson’s recent blueprint for Brexit revealed Ms May had lost her grip on her Cabinet and insisted Labour MPs would not dare to mount such an intervention under his leadership.
Emboldened by Labour’s performance at the polls in June, Mr Corbyn said he would keep the party on an election footing, vowing to unseat senior Conservative MPs with small majorities including Amber Rudd, Iain Duncan Smith and Justine Greening and to widen his tour of Tory marginal seats.
Speaking ahead of the party’s annual conference, he told The Guardian: “The election has changed politics in this country. We are now the mainstream. 
“The government lacks any sense of direction. They are hiding behind parliamentary power grabs to avoid scrutiny.” 
Mr Corbyn said he would “challenge the Tories at every step” in Parliament and across the country as he pledged to roll out his tour of marginal seats to 100 constituencies by the end of the year.
He said: “It is a government that is in disarray. We will keep up pressure in parliament. 
""There is a social agenda, investment, housing, health and social care and industrial needs … We are ready for an election and we will keep on demanding that this takes place in parliament.”
He said Labour was already selecting candidates in key seats and putting detailed policy papers together.
""We are preparing by campaigning over the country, continuing to challenge austerity,"" he said.
""And we have made enormous progress in changing the political debate. The campaign showed what Labour can do when we go out with a message of hope.""
He also attacked Mr Johnson's attempt to outline his Brexit vision only days before Ms May delivered a major speech on the EU withdrawal in Florence.
Mr Corbyn said: “It is a very strange set of circumstances when the Foreign Secretary writes a 4,000-word article for the Daily Telegraph. Which is essentially a manifesto for destroying workers’ rights, undercutting, damaging all the protections we enjoy.
Asked if a shadow cabinet member would behave that way, Mr Corbyn replied: “They wouldn't do it. It wouldn't happen. 
“We would expect and they would consult with my office before it was done.”

"Flint's lead-poisoned water had a 'horrifyingly large' effect on fetal deaths, finds study","The fertility rate in Flint, Michigan, dropped precipitously after the city decided to switch to lead-poisoned Flint River water in 2014, according to a new working paper.
That decline was primarily driven by what the authors call a ""culling of the least healthy fetuses"" resulting in a ""horrifyingly large"" increase in fetal deaths and miscarriages. The paper estimates that among the babies conceived from November 2013 through March 2015, ""between 198 and 276 more children would have been born had Flint not enacted the switch in water,"" write health economists Daniel Grossman of West Virginia University and David Slusky of Kansas University.
In April 2014, Flint decided to draw its public water supply from the Flint River, a temporary measure intended to save costs while the city worked on a permanent pipeline project to Lake Huron. Residents immediately began complaining about the odor and appearance of the water, but well into 2015 the city was still assuring residents that the water was safe to drink.
Subsequent testing by Flint authorities and outside agencies turned up lead levels that in some cases were dozens or hundreds times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency's safety threshold. A September 2015 study showed that the proportion of Flint children with high lead levels in their blood had roughly doubled after the water change. The city finally switched back to Lake Huron water in October 2015.
The harmful effects of lead exposure on children's health are well-documented. They include cognitive deficiencies, increased antisocial behavior, lower educational attainment, and a host of problems affecting the brain, kidneys and liver.
Less well-known are lead's effects on fetal health. Literature reviewed by Grossman and Slusky shows that maternal lead exposure is linked to ""fetal death, prenatal growth abnormalities, reduced gestational period, and reduced birth weight."" A 2013 study, for instance, found an increase in fetal deaths and a reduction of births in Washington, D.C., from 2000 to 2003, when lead levels were elevated in the city's drinking water.
​Grossman and Slusky wanted to know if something similar happened in Flint after lead-poisoned water was introduced in 2014. They compared birth and fetal death rates in Flint with those in other Michigan cities, including Lansing, Grand Rapids, Dearborn and Detroit.
""These areas provide a natural control group for Flint in that they are economically similar areas and, with the exception of the change in water supply, followed similar trends in fertility and birth outcomes over this time period,"" the authors say.
What they found was ""a substantial decrease in fertility rates in Flint for births conceived around October 2013, which persisted through the end of 2015. Flint switched its water source in April 2014, meaning these births would have been exposed to this new water for a substantial period in utero (i.e., at least one trimester).""
Other cities in Michigan showed no such drop.
During this time period, residents in Flint were generally unaware of the amount of lead in their water. ""Because the higher lead content of the new water supply was unknown at the time, this decrease in [the general fertility rate] is likely a reflection of an increase in fetal deaths and miscarriages and not a behavior change in sexual behavior related to conception like contraceptive use,"" Grossman and Slusky conclude.
They next turned to deaths of fetuses of 20 weeks gestation and older, excluding abortions, which are reported by hospitals. They found that ""fetal death rates increased in Flint but did not change substantially in other areas following the water change."" The change in Flint amounted to a 58 percent increase in fetal deaths, relative to areas not afflicted by lead-poisoned water, a change the authors characterized as ""horrifyingly large.""
Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression

When you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itself
David Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part

New research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.
Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.

Cycling to work is linked to a lower risk of developing cancer by 45 per cent and cardiovascular disease by 46 per cent, according to a study of a quarter of a million people.

Walking to work also brought health benefits, the University of Glasgow researchers found, but not to the same degree as cycling.

Scientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed

Major measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.
Anti-vaccine movements are believed to have contributed to low rates of immunisation against the highly contagious disease in countries such as Italy and Romania, which have both seen a recent spike in infections. Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO’s regional director for Europe, said it was “of particular concern that measles cases are climbing in Europe” when they had been dropping for years

The ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.
The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide
Scientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients' immune systems responded by producing ""killer"" T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany
A compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that individuals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”
Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of age
Parents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened
Scientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories
The technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way

The authors say their number probably undercounts the total number of miscarriages and fetal deaths for several reasons: ""(1) They do not include abortions; (2) they do not include miscarriages that occur before 20 weeks of gestation; and (3) they are restricted to hospitals reporting these events,"" Grossman and Slusky said.
The paper's findings on fertility and fetal death rates largely mirror the effects observed in Washington from 2000 to 2003. And the authors note that many effects probably fall outside the scope of the current research: The children born during this period were subsequently exposed to lead outside of the womb as well, potentially setting themselves up for a host of physical and behavioral problems later in life.
Flint is currently working on overhauling its water infrastructure, a process that local authorities say is likely to take years. At the end of 2016, 10 percent of Flint homes still had lead concentrations of 12 parts per billion or higher in their water, three times the level observed in Detroit.
Although the EPA threshold for safe drinking water is 15 parts of lead per billion, according to the World Health Organization ""there is no known level of lead exposure that is considered safe.""
Flint, according to 2016 Census estimates, is 53 percent African-American. In addition, 45 percent of Flint's residents live in poverty, and census data released last week showed that it is the nation's poorest city.
