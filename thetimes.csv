In 1792 the French Republic was proclaimed; in 1862 the US President Abraham Lincoln declared that all slaves in rebellious states would be free from January 1, 1863; in 1985 France’s prime minister, Laurent Fabius, admitted that French secret agents had sunk the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand.
Goldfinches are gathering in flocks to feed on thistle seeds. William Cobbett in his Rural Rides (1830) described how in September 1826 he was going along a road in Wiltshire that had masses of thistles beside it. Flocks of goldfinches were feeding on them, and rose up and flew ahead of him, with others continually joining them as he went on, until he estimated that there was “a flock of 10,000 flying before me”. That sounds exceptional, but large flocks of goldfinches still gather in such places. They eat the seeds that are still on the thistle tops, and also those that have fallen to the ground beneath. When they are disturbed the air around fills with the flashing gold of their wing bars, and they may settle, with tinkling twitterings, in nearby trees. Some of the young birds among them still have grey heads, but many have already acquired the wonderful red, white and black heads of their parents.

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Kirstie Allsopp recently told The Times that the one thing in her west London home that she could not live without was her boiling water tap.
“If I were getting married I’d say sod everything else and get everyone to chip in for a boiling water tap,” she said of the “amazing but expensive” kitchen gadget.
Allsopp isn’t the only fan. Rose Uniacke, the Beckhams’ interior designer, has a copper boiling water tap plumbed into her office in Chelsea, central London, behind a hand-carved wooden sink. “It’s the first place that I come in the morning,” Uniacke says. “It’s the perfect object, because every time I use it, it makes me happy.”
Forget about the kitchen island or the designer pantry, taps that provide instant…

September 22 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
Uber has been stripped of its operating licence in London.
Transport for London said that the company, which has more than 40,000 drivers in the capital, would be taken off the road when its current licence expires next week.
Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing app, with 3.5 million users in the capital, was heavily criticised by TfL for putting the public at risk.
It ruled that Uber had failed to report serious criminal offences, failed to check drivers’ criminal records and flouted rules on cheating software that bars officials from properly assessing how the app works.
The company, which is based in San Francisco, said that it was “astounded” by the ruling. It has enjoyed a meteoric rise since it was launched in 2009. It…

Sadiq Khan triggered a major political battle today which will sharply divide Labour and Tory MPs and dominate the next stage of the party conference season.
The Labour Mayor of London was accused of bowing to a campaign by the GMB union, while one of the Uber driver groups accused him of “cronyism” for agreeing to the demands of black cab companies.
Mr Khan, who was given a speaking slot at Labour conference at the last minute, backed the decision taken by TFL. “I fully support TfL’s decision - it would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners’ safety and security.

A French nanny who was allegedly burnt to death by the London family she worked for is thought to have been an aspiring actress and activist who had produced films on European history while at college.
The alleged victim, who police said was too badly burnt to establish an age or gender, is thought to be Sophie Lionnet, 21, from Troyes.
Sabrina Quider, 34, a mother of two young children, appeared alongside her boyfriend, Ouissem Medouni, 40, at Wimbledon magistrates’ court this morning, both dressed in identical grey prison tracksuits.
Ms Lionnet is believed to have worked for Ms Quider, who is French-Algerian, for about 14 months at her home in southwest London, having come to Britain to learn English. Friends of the young woman…

Fall in public borrowing brings budget boost
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
A faster-than-expected fall in government borrowing has handed the chancellor a windfall of more than £10 billion to support public services and infrastructure and help students and young homebuyers.
Official figures show that the deficit dropped to its lowest August level in a decade as VAT receipts hit record highs and day-to-day spending by the state declined.
If present trends persist, economists said that borrowing for the whole of 2017-18 could be £10 billion less than projections in March. Capital Economics said that the undershoot — below the official £58.3 billion budget deficit forecast — could reach £13 billion, giving a boost to Philip Hammond when he delivers the budget on November 22.
John Hawksworth, chief economist at PWC, said lower borrowing would give Mr…

"Vague May has ruined Britain’s credibility, says former aide","Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
Theresa May has undermined Britain’s credibility by being too vague about post-Brexit plans, according to a recently departed Downing Street official.
The prime minister must explain to the country the choices and trade-offs it faces rather than duck difficult decisions through “slogans that obscured rather than revealed meaning”, said Matt O’Toole.
Mr O’Toole was chief press officer in Downing Street until last month and his responsibilities included oversight of Brexit media handling. He set out his challenge shortly before her speech in Florence today.
Writing on the Politico website, he said that Mrs May still had no straightforward answer to the question of whether the UK would effectively stay in something close to the single market.
“You can legitimately argue that our prolonged vagueness gave…

Yahyah Farroukh, 21, was questioned by the Metropolitan Police for five days before being released last night with no further action.
He had lived with the same foster carers in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, as the unnamed 18-year-old refugee suspected of planting the device on the London Underground last Friday.
Omar Farroukh, 19, who lives in Cairo and is one of Mr Farroukh’s eight siblings, said that his mother had heart problems and went into hospital as soon as she heard about the arrest. The doctors believe that she will recover.
Omar Farroukh said that the family were “very happy” that…

"Police anti-terrorism budget being cut, says Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick","Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
The counterterrorism budget is to reduce over the next three years despite a string of terrorist attacks and the severe threat level placing a strain on resources, according to Britain’s most senior police officer.
Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, warned this morning that it was “not sustainable for my police service” if the terrorist threat continued at the same pace.
She said that she agreed with Sara Thornton, the head of the National Police Chiefs Council, who said today that the huge counterterrorism effort was putting wider policing under unsustainable pressure.
The government has said that it was increasing counterterrorism funding by £3.4 billion. It points to the extra £24 million allocated to counterterrorism policing this year, on top of the £707…

Orthodox leaders call for boycott of Lidl and Nestlé,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
The Greek Orthodox Church has urged worshippers to boycott Lidl and Nestlé after they airbrushed out Christian symbols from food packaging.
The German discount supermarket removed crucifix imagery from the packaging of Greek products, arguing that it wanted to remain “religiously neutral”.
The company apologised to customers who complained that they were deeply offended by the move but it has refused to reinstate the religious symbols on the range of products which include yoghurt, cheese, olive oil and moussaka.
The packaging features the famous blue-domed churches on the island of Santorini, all of which have crosses on top.
Nestlé and a large local dairy producer, Mevgal, have also now removed religious imagery from their Greek yoghurts.
A spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Church in Athens…

Early in 1932, Pablo Picasso was wrestling with both the betrayal of his wife for a muse several decades younger and his place in the art history pantheon.
The result? An astonishing five-day creative burst that produced three masterpieces that, if sold, would each challenge auction house records.
For the first time since their creation in Picasso’s “year of wonders” the three paintings are to be shown together. Tate Modern unveiled details yesterday of its “once in a lifetime” exhibition devoted to the most influential artist of the 20th century.
Drawing on private collections and the world’s leading institutions, more than 100 paintings, sculptures and works on papers produced by the artist in 1932 are to be shown in the gallery’s first solo exhibition of…

Mothers not warned of epilepsy drug risks,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
More than two thirds of women with epilepsy who take a powerful drug that can cause birth defects are not warned about its risks, according to new research.
Campaigners said that thousands of babies would continue to be born with disabilities unless officials stepped up efforts to educate mothers-to-be.
Sodium valproate, also known as Epilim, carries a ten per cent risk of physical abnormalities in unborn babies, and a 40 per cent risk of developing problems such as autism, low IQ or learning disabilities. Around 20,000 babies in the UK are believed to have been left with disabilities since its introduction in the 1970s.
For some women with epilepsy, sodium valproate is the only drug that will control their seizures, leaving medics with a difficult…

Radio 4 revolt over ‘lightweight’ new Today programme,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Radio 4’s most prestigious news programme is facing a backlash from staff and listeners over its new “lightweight” direction.
Sarah Sands, the recently appointed editor of Today, has instructed the morning show to give greater prominence to “girls’ stuff” and “treat fashion a bit like science”. She has also requested fewer serious stories about hospitals and prisons, and suggested that the programme should feel like an “ambassador’s reception”.
The show’s presenters, John Humphrys, Nick Robinson, Sarah Montague, Mishal Husain and Justin Webb, are understood to be supportive of Sands but are wary that the programme’s focus on arts and fashion could mean that news coverage is cut back.
There are also worries that the main 8.10am interview, traditionally with a senior politician, is failing to…

Property developers ask the Prince of Wales to approve shortlists of architects and proposed building designs, it has been claimed.
Lord Rogers of Riverside, one of the world’s leading architects, says that five developers told him that they presented names of practices to Clarence House “to check who would be acceptable”. The architect, whose own designs were blocked by Prince Charles, said a developer told him that consulting the prince over plans was “one way we can minimise risk”.
His claims will reopen the debate over the degree of influence that Charles, who is 68, has on the built environment. Ever since he stunned the architecture profession in 1984 with an attack on a proposed extension to the National Gallery, he has intervened privately and…

Two Buddhists have been fined for throwing live crabs and lobsters into the Channel in a misguided bid to save their lives, causing “significant” harm to the environment.
Zhixiong Li, 30, and Ni Li, 33, both from London, caused serious damage when they released £5,000 worth of crustaceans into Brighton Marina in 2015.
They were part of a 1,000-strong congregation holding a “fang sheng”, or life release, ceremony to celebrate the visit of Taiwanese Buddhist master Hai Tao. This involved saving the lives of animals destined for slaughter. The principal belief is that returning animals to the wild restores karma.
The animals were not native species, however, and the act caused “untold damage” to marine life because the animals could take over from and mate…

But it has at least been confirmed: the Queen has an iPod.
And, given that it is there in her drawing room, sitting on a dock ready to be played at any moment, rather than put away forgotten in a drawer somewhere, presumably it is used on a regular basis.
Yes, autumn evenings at Balmoral might turn out to be more lively than anyone assumed.
The existence of the iPod emerged as a picture was released of the Queen in a private audience with Sir Peter Cosgrove, the governor-general of Australia, and Lady Cosgrove at Balmoral Castle.

Emergency services are spending thousands of pounds on 25-stone mannequins to practise rescuing obese patients.
Fire and ambulance workers have long simulated saving heavier patients but one service has invested in obese models that can be posed to make the scenario more realistic.
The bariatric mannequins, known both as bariquins and Barry, can be dismantled into 15 parts to simulate limb loss and imitate injury positions.
One in four British adults is obese and fire chiefs have decided that incidents involving such victims are so common that they need to invest in realistic models, rather than using sandbags.
Almost 1,000 NHS staff have been injured while caring for obese patients over a five-year period.

The former Great Yarmouth High School in Norfolk was taken over by the Inspiration Trust this summer and reopened this month as Great Yarmouth Charter Academy.
To improve standards at the school, where a third of last year’s GCSE students did not achieve pass grades in English or maths, strict rules were introduced.
Pupils are instructed to track teachers with their eyes during lessons and to walk silently in single file in corridors.

Scientists have shown that by trying and repeatedly failing at a task, you help children to learn the value of perseverance. If not broccoli.
The research, published in the journal Science, involved more than 250 15-month-old children watching adults perform a task. The adults were given a box, then told to say: “Look, there is something inside of here! I want to get it out!” Then they had to open it and take a…

“Come on Boris, let’s go out together in a show of unity.” Philip Hammond’s invitation in the lobby of No 10 shows it is not just the foreign secretary who knows how to play a cute media game.
The display of bonhomie after yesterday’s cabinet meeting to discuss the contents of Theresa May’s Brexit speech today belied how tense relations remain between the two men.
Both were reprimanded for allowing their private feud over how Britain should leave the EU to boil over into a public row during the two-hour cabinet meeting as at least five ministers called for an end to the infighting.
Mr Johnson’s cabinet critics exchanged knowing looks when he heaped praise on the prime minister. “It’s such a pattern, set up…

When Theresa May announced that she planned to break the Brexit deadlock with a speech in Florence, her spokesman said she wanted to travel to “a city known for its historical trading power”.
A photograph of Olly Robbins, the prime minister’s negotiating sherpa, carrying an early draft of the speech suggested that Mrs May will offer a cultural, as well as mercantile, justification for the venue — extolling Florence as the city that “taught us what it is to be European”, amid a paean to the Renaissance.
Santa Maria Novella, where Mrs May will speak, is one of the city’s great basilicas. She will be joined by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, while the audience…

“We will listen attentively and constructively to Theresa May’s important speech tomorrow in Florence.
“A rapid agreement on the conditions of the UK’s orderly withdrawal, and a transition period, is possible. For that to happen we would like the United Kingdom to put on the table, as soon as next week, proposals to overcome the barriers.”

Theresa May aims to kickstart Brexit talks with Florence speech,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.

Matt Chorley, Red Box Editor
There are a lot of “big moments” in the great story we call Brexit which are actually nothing of the sort: minor blips, irrelevant sideshows or simply agendas being pushed by people who know that they are never going to happen.
Today is different. Theresa May’s speech in Florence is a genuine attempt to make an offer to Brussels to kickstart the stalled talks on the divorce, secure outline agreement on a transition period and move towards looking at a long-term post-Brexit relationship.
Is it enough to unblock the logjam? “Probably not,” says one cabinet minister. “But it is a fair effort.”

Donald Trump refused to tell Theresa May his decision on the future of the Iran nuclear deal when the pair met earlier this week, as tensions between the US and its European allies flare.
Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, told reporters in New York yesterday that the president had refused to reveal his decision on whether to certify the deal when pressed by Mrs May.
Mr Trump used his appearance before the UN’s general assembly earlier this week to ramp up his rhetoric around the agreement. He revealed on Wednesday that he had reached a decision on whether or not he would certify the deal, which he must do every 90 days, but did not go into specifics.
“He has not shared that…

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Theresa May will use a champagne reception at Chequers tomorrow to improve relations with her backbench MPs.
The prime minister has invited about 30 Conservative MPs and their partners to the 16th-century residence in Buckinghamshire as part of efforts to shore up her position after the party lost seats at the general election.
The guest list is understood to include about ten MPs from the 2015 and 2017 intake, signalling moves to unite the pro-Remain and Eurosceptic wings of her party around her plan for breaking the deadlock in Brexit negotiations.
Mrs May’s speech in Florence is expected to include an outline for a transition period and payments into European Union institutions beyond 2019.
One MP invited to the gathering emphasised the need to allow…

A lawyer working on the case of the murdered Italian student Giulio Regeni said that he had been tortured by Egyptian guards and held in solitary confinement after being arrested at Cairo airport while trying to board a plane.
Ibrahim Metwaly, 53, was travelling to Geneva to address a UN working group about Mr Regeni’s killing and state kidnappings in Egypt when he vanished ten days ago. He was found in detention in Cairo, where he was being held on charges of “communicating with foreign entities to harm state security” and forming a group “against the law and the constitution”.
Mr Metwaly spoke of his treatment at a hearing yesterday to extend his detention by 15 days, according to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and…

The moments before Brady’s death at the age of 79 on May 15 at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Merseyside were revealed along with the conclusion that he died from heart failure, secondary to bronchopneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or lung disease.
Brady tortured and murdered five children aged between ten and 17 with his girlfriend, Myra Hindley, between 1963 and 1965.

The government is to require banks and building societies to conduct immigration checks on all 70 million current account holders from January.
The Home Office expects the checks, which will take place quarterly, to identify 6,000 people who have overstayed their visas, been refused asylum or are offenders who face deportation.
The banking regulations, approved by parliament in December 2016, are one of a number of measures in the Immigration Act 2016 that aim to encourage illegal immigrants to leave the UK.
Checks are already carried out on anyone opening a new bank or building society account under the 2014 Immigration Act but this is the first such requirement on all existing accounts.

Two brothers, both doctors, are joint owners of a London house where 35 men were found sleeping on mattresses after a raid by police and council officials.
Sunil Hathi, who owns the property with his brother Neil and mother Meenaxi, threatened legal action against Brent council for referring to him as a rogue landlord, saying he was oblivious to conditions at the property.
Mr Hathi said that he was shocked to discover that the three-bedroom house in Brent, northwest London, had been raided after complaints of overcrowding by neighbours.
Bare mattresses lined each of its three bedrooms, the kitchen and every other room except the bathrooms. There was even a gazebo on a patio with a mattress inside.

The curtain is to come down early on the woman who was brought in with the brief of rescuing English National Opera.
Cressida Pollock, a former McKinsey management consultant, said that she would be leaving before her contract expired having “secured” the company’s future.
Ms Pollock was appointed in March 2015 shortly after the Arts Council raised concerns about ENO’s financial sustainability, placing it in special measures and cutting its annual subsidy.
During her tenure the company made a series of unpopular decisions including cutting the number of annual productions, allowing musicals to be held at its London Coliseum home and reducing the pay of its chorus. Industrial action was only narrowly averted.
There was an inevitable tension between Ms Pollock and the opera’s creative…

Patients will be forced to wait at least three months for routine surgery as increasingly desperate health chiefs use treatment delays to cut costs.
Thousands of patients in Cambridgeshire will have to wait twice as long as they do now for procedures such as hip and knee replacements under the most radical rationing plans to come out of a tough NHS savings drive.
Doctors and patient groups condemned the “unjustified” minimum wait policy, which they said would lead to patients getting more ill while they were denied life-changing treatment.
Ministers ordered an end to “unfair” minimum wait policies six years ago after a report found that NHS bosses were attempting to control costs by delaying treatment, during which time some patients would give up, go…

At least 860,000 children in the UK are suffering from a little-known condition that causes learning difficulties and continues into adulthood, experts say.
Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), which appears to be genetic, affects about 7.5 per cent of children, or approximately two in every classroom. About half are undiagnosed.
Children with DLD have problems with speaking and listening such as a limited vocabulary, short and immature sentence structure, being unable to tell stories with structure and not understanding what they are being asked to do. As they get older they may struggle to find employment or form relationships.

Supporters of the terrorist group around the world are increasingly using Instagram “stories”, which disappear after 24 hours, to spread propaganda, a major analysis has found.
The discovery comes after Google, Facebook and other social media giants were threatened with fines by Theresa May and other European leaders at the UN general assembly in New York if they failed to remove extremism within two hours.

Christian schools are serving pupils halal meat from animals that have not been stunned before slaughter.
The schools could be serving the meat to any pupil, not just to Muslims, and may be failing to inform parents of what they are doing, according to Geoff Driver, the Conservative leader of Lancashire county council.
He said that the council should ban meat from non-stunned animals and described cutting an animal’s throat without first making it insensible to pain as abhorrent. His proposal will be put to the council on October 26.
Twenty-seven schools with a total of 12,000 pupils in Lancashire serve meat from halal suppliers that do not stun animals under a contract with the council. These include several Church of England and Catholic schools.

Fracking could be blocked in large parts of the countryside because of a dispute between the government and landowners over liability for abandoned shale gas wells.
The Country Land and Business Association, which represents more than 30,000 landowners, is advising members to consider refusing permission for fracking until they receive assurances that they will not be held liable for environmental damage.
Tim Breitmeyer, the association’s deputy president, wrote this week to Richard Harrington, the energy minister, asking him to ensure landowners were not liable when a fracking company became insolvent.
He said: “Although this risk may be small, the consequences are significant, as it would leave landowners facing significant costs to make a well safe to ensure it did not cause damage to their land…

Dominic Grieve, the cerebral former attorney-general, will be a thorn in the side of the prime minister as she tries to get her Brexit legislation past the Commons. The Tory MP, right, is an ardent Francophile and last year was awarded the Légion d’honneur, as his father had been. On the mantlepiece of Grieve’s office is a bronze clock that belonged to a relative who was a doctor in Paris in the early 19th century. He received a medal from the city, Grieve tells Conservative Home, for his work during a cholera outbreak but he suspects it was also due to him writing the definitive treatise on nymphomania. The way to a Frenchman’s heart is through. . .

EU risks trade war with radical plan to tax tech giants,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.

The European Union may tear up international agreements on taxation, potentially triggering a transatlantic trade war, unless the US agrees to new levies on companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple.
The possibility was raised in proposals tabled yesterday, while radical plans from the European Commission also threaten the use of emergency EU powers to suspend national vetoes on taxation.
It says the powers are required to prevent distortions in the single market caused by international tax loopholes. Google and Apple pay tax bills in many European countries that are on average less than half of those of some other companies. Last year it emerged that Google paid just £130 million in British taxes over a decade, but generated £4.9 billion in the last tax…

Red squirrels resurgent on Northumberland estate after cull of grey rivals,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Red squirrels are back on top at the National Trust’s largest agricultural estate after a six-year campaign to kill off hundreds of invasive greys.
The native red squirrels, which are classed as near threatened in England and Wales, had been almost wiped out at Wallington estate in Northumberland when rangers started culling the greys in 2011.
Grey squirrels, which first arrived from North America in the 1870s, carry squirrel parapox. They are immune to the virus but it is fatal to their red cousins.
They also compete for shelter and green acorns — one of the main foods for the reds, which have lived on the British Isles for at least 10,000 years.
The National Trust said that the squirrel population on the 13,000-acre estate,…

A 21-year-old Syrian refugee and another man arrested in connection with the Parsons Green Tube bomb were released yesterday and told that police would take no further action.
Yahyah Farroukh had lived with the same foster carers in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, as the unnamed 18-year-old refugee who is suspected of having planted the device last Friday.
Mr Farroukh’s family had said they were sure he would be cleared after he was arrested on Saturday outside the chicken shop where he worked in Hounslow, west London. A 48-year-old man arrested in Newport, Wales, on Wednesday was also released last night. The 18-year-old suspect and three other men were still being questioned.
A boy of 17 was arrested early yesterday morning in Thornton Heath, south London, at a…

Wisdom arises from a handful of particular areas in the brain and can be measured from the answers to 24 questions, according to neuroscientists. One day it may even be possible for doctors to boost the characteristic.
Dilip Jeste, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, claims that wisdom is made up of six different qualities: emotional control, a knack for giving good advice, pragmatism, self-understanding, tolerance of diversity and the ability to handle ambiguity and uncertainty.
This in itself is nothing new but modern psychiatrists have become increasingly interested in pinning down the elements of wisdom. Several studies have linked it to better well- being, resilience and physical health.
Writing in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, Professor Jeste and his colleagues…

"Pilots have it easy, says Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary as he tackles flights chaos","Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
The chief executive of Ryanair raised the stakes in his dispute with the airline’s pilots yesterday by insisting that some were “precious” and had a “very easy job”.
Michael O’Leary accused some pilots of being “full of their own self- importance” as Ryanair struggled to contain the chaos that will lead to almost 2,100 aircraft being grounded over the next six weeks.
The airline has admitted making a “mess” of pilot rotas, leaving it short of flight crew. The travel plans of 315,000 passengers will be affected.
Mr O’Leary, who was paid almost £3 million last year, admitted yesterday that further cancellations were possible. He said that the airline planned to hire an additional 125 pilots over the next fortnight.
At the airline’s annual general…

Financial services in Britain are not clustered in London but scattered across the country; the southeast is less productive than the M4 corridor to Bristol; and Britain not only suffers from a north-south divide but from a coastal-inland divide as well.
A study into the industrial breakdown of the country by the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the London School of Economics has exposed some well-worn assumptions about the UK economy as myths and raised questions about how to spread prosperity across the nation.
The CEP hopes its work will inform the government’s industrial strategy, which will be announced before December, and is intended to tackle the UK’s dreadful productivity: it takes a working week to produce the same amount of goods and services…

The battle against touts has gone digital. A London venue has become the first in Britain to ban paper tickets from its box office in favour of electronic ones that cannot be transferred or resold.
All tickets sold through the box office at Islington Assembly Hall will be issued for smartphones only. Concert-goers will have to download the ticket using an app that features protections to ensure it cannot be sold on.
Tickets on the app only go live an hour before the gig and the ticket itself has animated elements. If someone presents a ticket at the venue without these moving elements, security staff will know that someone has taken a screengrab of the original ticket and tried to pass or sell it on.

Tide turns for sea turtles after decades of decline in western Pacific,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.

The sea turtle population is growing, apparently bringing a halt to decades of decline, after a clampdown on destructive fishing methods and better protection of nesting sites.
Turtle numbers are on the rise in 12 of the main areas of ocean that they inhabit and falling in five.
Green and loggerhead turtles are recovering or stable in most areas, while leatherbacks are still declining in the eastern and western Pacific.
The greatest recovery has been in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, according to research by Deakin University in Australia published in the journal Science Advances.
The authors attributed the overall increase to “effective protection of eggs and nesting females, as well as reduced bycatch”.
Some tuna fishing companies have stopped using aggregating devices — floating objects…

The couple who provided a refuge for one of the world’s greatest dancers have finally been rewarded — with a blue plaque on their old home.
Rudolf Nureyev described Nigel and Maude Gosling as his “parents in the West” after his defection from the Soviet Union in the 1960s to begin his dance career in western Europe.
Yesterday English Heritage unveiled the plaque on the couple’s four-storey home in Kensington, which it described as “an escape from the pressures of performing and socialising”.
The Goslings, who were dance critics under the joint name of Alexander Bland, had been asked by their friend Margot Fonteyn to help the dancer. In June 1961 he had been touring with the Kirov Ballet in Paris when he sought political…

Sir James Dyson, the billionaire entrepreneur behind the famous electrical product range, has pocketed a huge bonus after his parent company paid out £111 million in dividends.
Weybourne, the group behind his Dyson empire of vacuum cleaners, fans and dryers, enjoyed a surge in sales and profits last year as shoppers snapped up its new hairdryer and from growing demand in the United States and Asia.
It was not clear how much of the combined £111 million dividends goes to Sir James but he is expected to receive a significant amount as the controlling shareholder. The payout is modest compared with the estimated £7.8 billion fortune the businessman has amassed over his career. The Sunday Times rich list ranked Sir James and his family the…

Supermarkets will no longer be named by the food standards watchdog over how many of their chickens are contaminated with a life-threatening bug.
Campylobacter is the leading cause of food poisoning in the UK, with 280,000 people falling ill and 100 people dying from the bug every year.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has regularly reported the percentage of chickens sold with campylobacter by the nine biggest supermarkets since 2014. However, yesterday the watchdog announced a deal with retailers that means in future it will only publish an industry average figure.
Supermarkets will still be required to report on their websites the proportion of chickens that carry the highest level of contamination but not the figure showing overall contamination
Despite recent reductions in infection rates…

A close friend of the man who led the London Bridge terrorists has been jailed for four and a half years after making an Islamic State propaganda video outside Windsor Castle.
Taha Hussain, 21, from Slough in Berkshire, ran two YouTube channels and used the messaging apps Telegram and Whatsapp to share material.
Hussain was an associate of Khuram Butt, 27, who led Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, in a vehicle and knife attack that killed eight people on London Bridge and in Borough Market in June. They were shot dead by police.
A source said Hussain and Butt were “close pals” and that Hussain “could easily have gone on to be part of the same plot” if he had not been arrested.

Fans have long wondered why Tintin, the intrepid boy reporter, does not much care for girls. That may be because he was a girl himself, according to a French philosopher.
Vincent Cespedes, 44, has caused a stir with his foray into the decades-old sport of decoding the ambiguous hero created in 1929 by Hergé, a Belgian comic-book author.
“For his creator, Tintin was always a girl. An androgynous and probably asexual redhead with blue eyes,” Mr Cespedes wrote. “Hergé would be hooting with laughter observing that, 30 years after his death . . . the whole world still believes that his ‘tomboy’ is well and truly a real boy.” Hergé used to call his hero a tomboy with “a few friends who were in on the joke,” he…

Milan Fashion Week: Reinvention in the DNA for Max Mara,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
How does a brand famed for its camelhair winter coats deliver a collection for spring/summer? That was the question Max Mara set about answering in Milan yesterday.
Luxury brands like to talk about their design DNA, shorthand for “What are the clothes our customers expect from us, and how do we deliver those clothes every six months with enough of a point of difference to keep our customers buying?”
Recently Max Mara has — after a few years of dreariness — proved adept at this seeming contradiction.
For next season its signature hue was rendered in semi-transparent organza and sharply tailored into suiting, plus coats so lightweight as to be decorative rather than functional. Add to the mix those same separates in a mauve-on-white floral,…

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
A former police constable has been convicted of secretly filming his sexual encounters with seven women.
Jayson Lobo, 48, a former athlete who won the British 800m title in 1998, met most of his victims on the dating website Match.com and covertly recorded them on his mobile phone.
His deceit was uncovered when one of his victims found out he had a long-term partner. She had previously caught him filming her as they had sex but he promised to delete it.
The woman thought that too could be a lie and went to the police, Liverpool crown court heard.
Lobo, from Blackburn, was arrested and had his phones seized. More clips of the woman were found, along with a string of clips and images of…

"Forget the gym, walking to work cuts risk of early death by a third","Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Spending half an hour a day walking to the office or doing housework could cut the risk of early death by a third, a global study suggests.
Any activity that quickens the pulse helps to protect people against heart disease and other fatal illness, with most of the health gain coming from lower levels of exercise, researchers concluded.
Scientists said that the findings underlined that people did not need to go to the gym to reap substantial health benefits from being active in daily life.
Two and a half hours of moderate activity a week, about 20 minutes a day, has long been recommended by doctors but four in ten people do not manage this much.
Now scientists have used data on 131,000 people in…

Ivory Coast fears chocolate meltdown from Brexit,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.

Ivory Coast, which produces 40 per cent of the world’s cocoa, fears Britain’s exit from the European Union could trigger its own economic meltdown.
Amadou Gon Coulibaly, prime minister of the west African nation, said that his government was following the Brexit talks with particular concern.
“The UK is going through Brexit and we hope its economy will continue to thrive . . . but cocoa is priced in sterling and the CFA franc [the Ivorian currency] is linked to the euro, so when the pound falls it is a loss for us,” he told the Financial Times.
The pound has fallen about 14 per cent against the euro since the UK referendum in June last year, and in some bureaux de change it is…

Fifty cases involving individuals who have made accusations of abuse after undergoing regression therapy are being investigated by a charity.
The therapy, which was used by a woman who accused her hippy mother of cruelty, was described by experts yesterday as “nonsense” and “pure conjecture”.
Rosa Aguelo de Guero, 42, alleged that her mother had banged her head against a wall, forced her to clean a toilet and stuffed underwear into her mouth so that she could not scream.
Susan Wynne-Willson, 69, who was married to a former Pink Floyd lighting technician, was cleared after the trial was told that her daughter had used regression therapy.
The practice involves psychotherapists or hypnotherapists encouraging their patients to “regress” into their childhood to uncover abuse or trauma.…

The trend for dressing down has extended to the grave as more people choose to be buried in jeans, football shirts or pyjamas.
Top funeral directors have said that the tradition of being buried in your “Sunday best”, such as a formal suit or smart dress, has given way to more personalised funerals, with outfits chosen for their comfort and familiarity rather than their formality.
The decision is often made by relatives, who feel it helps them in their grief to know that their loved one has been laid to rest in clothes they liked and felt comfortable in, often with photographs, books, jewellery and even alcohol and cigarettes placed in the coffin.
“Requests to personalise a funeral often mirror general trends in wider society,”…

Motorists cut insurance bills by 20% with dashboard cameras,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.

Motorists are resorting to dash cameras in record numbers to thwart crash-for-cash scams and help to drive down insurance premiums.
Sales of the cameras, which can be bought for less than £20, have doubled over the past year. More than one in ten vehicles now have one.
Experts predict that widespread adoption will dramatically improve road safety because the near-certainty of being filmed will encourage better driving.
Dash-cam footage is already being used to solve disputes over liability and block whiplash claims from criminal gangs that stage hundreds of crashes a year.
Natasha Chauhan, of Halfords, where dash cam sales have risen by 104 per cent in 12 months, said: “We have seen a surge in sales as drivers reach for in-car technology to capture…

Unfortunately for Mike Batt recent projects appear to have been less lucrative. The songwriter and producer has filed for personal bankruptcy and resigned as director of Dramatico, his record label.
He declined to comment yesterday but he has spoken previously about taking risks with his money. “I have been nearly bankrupt two or three times,” he said in 2008. “Whenever I have a little bit of money, I spend it bringing about the next artistic goal I want to achieve.”
Batt, 68, made £1 million from The Wombles songs in the 1970s. He waived a £200 fee in exchange for the rights…

A moped gang held two women in their 60s at knifepoint before ripping gold chains from their necks and attacking an elderly man who rushed to help.
The four attackers approached on two mopeds and the two riding pillion got off and threatened the women with a knife, shortly after 3pm on Wednesday in Thornton Heath, south London.
As they snatched the gold chains a man in his 70s rushed to help the women but he was thrown to the ground and the attackers escaped on the mopeds.
The four men, three of whom were believed to be white and one black, were all wearing motorcycle helmets.
The Metropolitan Police, which released CCTV footage of the robbery, left, said: “The witness who intervened was taken…

The Archbishop of Canterbury has said it is not a problem for a boy to wear a dress, as he intervened in a row over a Church of England school that welcomed transgender pupils.
Nigel and Sally Rowe, who are Christians, removed their six-year-old son from a primary school on the Isle of Wight after a boy in his class was permitted to wear a dress.
The couple said that their son was confused by this and it was wrong for young children to “embrace transgenderism” as it conflicted with biblical values. They have threatened to sue the school.
The Most Rev Justin Welby was asked on LBC radio how he would reply to objections on Christian grounds to a boy wearing a dress at…

A military veterans’ charity was accused last night of wasting money by spending nearly £45,000 on rebranding and a new logo.
Combat Stress, which offers mental health services to former troops, released the logo this week with its name written in red and blue compared with black and grey previously.
Trevor Coult, 42, a former colour sergeant who was awarded the Military Cross for service in Iraq, wrote on Twitter that the money could have been used to help “quite a few wounded men and women”.
He told The Times: “I find it an absolute waste of funds. If they would involve themselves with other military charities we could have helped them with this for a fraction of the cost.” Mr Coult is a patron…

Environmental activists blocked a cargo ship from unloading 1,200 Volkswagen cars in a protest about air pollution from diesel engines.
Greenpeace protesters used kayaks and boats to reach the 23,000-tonne car carrier in the Thames Estuary yesterday. They climbed up and suspended themselves from the ship’s 27m-high unloading door and have said they will remain until Volkswagen “takes its toxic cars back to Germany”. The ship turned around and sailed to Margate with the climbers still in position, according to Greenpeace. Last night three activists were arrested.
More than 40 environmentalists also scaled fences at Sheerness port, Kent, the intended destination of the ship where thousands more VW cars are awaiting distribution, Greenpeace said.
A VW spokeswoman said: “The ship contains a variety of Volkswagen…

You can be forgiven for not having followed every twist and turn of this year’s German election campaign.
Without a pantomime villain such as Geert Wilders or Marine Le Pen, and with Angela Merkel so comfortably ahead in the polls, the Bundestag election has received less coverage than other European elections this year.
So for those who want to mug up ahead of Sunday, here are the salient points from my Brief guide to the German election, co-authored with Claudia Chwalisz, and published by the Legatum Institute.
Bar anything exceptional happening, it looks like Germany will have another four years with ‘Mutti’ at the helm. The strong performance of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is directly linked to her leadership — she is more popular than…

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Jill Rutter, programme director at the Institute for GovernmentTheresa May is finally making a speech on Europe –aimed at a European audience. But 10 days later she will be addressing her party in Manchester. Her first task is to ensure there is a single message in both speeches.
Unblocking the negotiations with the EU 27 will be her second aim. To do that, she needs not only to paint a rosy picture of the future partnership, but to break the impasse on phase one.
This means signalling the terms she is prepared to accept (submit to?) for agreeing a transition and going far enough beyond the mantra of “meeting our legal obligations” on money for the European Council to judge “sufficient progress”.
She will also…

What do the nurses at Worthing hospital have in common with the managers of Toyota’s plant in Japan?
I’ve spent this week in South Korea and Japan finding out. I’m here because the government needs to understand the best ideas and approaches that can cut public sector waste and give our excellent frontline staff what they need to continue to be the best in the world.
Both countries have high performing and advanced public services — doing well in international comparisons from health to education.
I’ve seen the ground-breaking innovation South Korea and Japan are embracing, from the use of “big data” to map traffic and crime in Seoul, to robotic surgical equipment which can carry out operations with pinpoint precision. But what I find…

Drug dealers seeking customers among freshers at Manchester University have been handing out business cards near halls of residence. One person living in the Fallowfield area of the city claimed that students had been given samples of cannabis with the cards, adding: “It’s disgusting. Most parents dropping their kids at uni have no idea.”
Superintendent Dave Pester of Greater Manchester police said that patrols had been increased across the area.

For decades, governments have dodged the inconvenient truth that the state has a role in housebuilding
The covenant of British politics is broken. The European referendum of 2016 was the first clue and the strange general election a year later the second. As the political assemblies gather at their conferences to contemplate their own little world, the gap between the promise of politics and popular problems has perhaps never been greater. There will be urgently missable fringe meetings in Brighton and Manchester over the next fortnight which seek to draw lessons from Syriza’s Greece, Trump’s America or Macron’s France. The problem can be located much closer to home.
Housing minister was once a cabinet position and really must be again. For an issue which has so frequently paid a political dividend it has been remarkably relegated down the order of priorities.…

Stung by the robust US response to its hacking operations, Russia is playing a different propaganda game in Germany
Russia has all the ammunition it needs to attack Angela Merkel, with a trove of stolen emails and documents from the German parliament and from the chancellor’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Selectively edited and leaked, they would show politicians committing politics: intriguing, dissembling and backstabbing. Voters would be shocked. Similar revelations helped to doom Hillary Clinton’s chances against Donald Trump but as Sunday’s election nears, the silence on the German front is deafening. The Kremlin is apparently holding fire. Why?
One clue lies in France, where Russia tried the same trick, hacking into Emmanuel Macron’s campaign, purloining emails and releasing them on the eve of the presidential election. But unlike their American counterparts, French journalists did not hurtle breathlessly into print with whatever examples of…

A new study shows poor productivity is not explained by simplistic talk of a north-south divide
Let’s start with the good news: there are some regions of Britain where the economic productivity rate is higher than the German average. Now the bad news: there are three of them. Three out of 168.
In fact when it comes economic bang-for-buck, which is ultimately what productivity is, only the London borough of Tower Hamlets, which includes Canary Wharf, would scrape into the German top five. Nowhere in this country can compete with the output per hour generated in Munich, Ingolstadt or Wolfsburg, home to BMW, Audi, and VW.
There is nothing new in the idea that the British economy is less productive than most of its industrialised counterparts. You probably already knew that for every hour worked, the French and Americans generate about…

I can’t claim to have been much burdened by wolf-whistlers over the years. There was the odd lewd remark from van men when I was young but I sensed their hearts weren’t really in it.
Now, in an attempt to end France’s “macho culture”, Emmanuel Macron is said to want to penalise men who harass women by badgering them for their phone numbers or whistling at them in the street.
Good. But I’m not sure the wolf-whistling bit is entirely necessary any more. It seems to be an older man’s game from a bygone era. Young women I’ve asked say it rarely happens to them, and it certainly doesn’t come from their peers. Indeed a recent survey of tradesmen found most wouldn’t dream of whistling…

Today marks World Rhino Day and the crisis that could drive this remarkable creature to extinction in our lifetime. Demand for rhino horn in Asia is behind the deaths of nearly 7,000 over the past ten years at the hands of poachers.
The use of rhino horn in traditional Chinese medicines is being overtaken by demand for it as sculpted works of art. As its price rises on the black market, smugglers are turning to more ingenious ways of getting it out of South Africa, where most rhino are found, to buyers in Vietnam and China, often disguised as jewellery or foodstuffs.
We in the West spend too little on helping wildlife law enforcement in Africa to tackle this trade. With wildlife trafficking worth an…

Anxious Germans are poised to return the chancellor to power but she cannot ignore the rumblings of discontent about migrant integration
As a schoolgirl in communist East Germany Angela Merkel famously stood on the edge of a high diving board for 40 minutes, weighing up the risks. Only when the bell signified the end of the swimming lesson, and when her teacher’s patience had been exhausted, did she choose to jump.
Germans are this weekend set to re-elect a leader whose hallmark is careful, risk-averse statecraft, and who is a master of timing. Since Mrs Merkel’s last election in 2013, Russia has destabilised Ukraine, the eurozone has scrambled out of deep crisis, Britain has voted to leave the European Union and the United States has elected as president a maverick businessman. Syria has been torn apart and jihadists routinely attack European capitals. Through all of this…

Though public finances are improving, private sector savings are worryingly low
Britain’s public finances are improving. The budget deficit is narrowing faster than financial markets were expecting. It’s not before time and will provide Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the exchequer, a greater degree of fiscal leeway in his budget in November.
Yet the very fact of a continued budget deficit at this stage of a recovery and the reasons why it has suddenly shrunk are worrying for Britain’s prospects. Public debt remains high as a proportion of national income, and the economy is unbalanced. Britain cannot succeed in a post-Brexit era by relying on a model of consumption fuelled by borrowing, which appears to be what is keeping the economy afloat at the moment.
The data on government borrowing is broadly encouraging. Figures released yesterday…

In Florence, Theresa May hopes to find a room with a view of the future
The forecast for Florence today is 24 degrees and sunny. The summer crowds are at last beginning to recede. It might be the perfect day to visit, but look out for heavy security near the basilica of Santa Maria Novella. Be ready to step around a silent protest by British expatriates hoping to keep their healthcare and their right of abode.
Their prime minister, Theresa May, will be giving a speech today next to the church. She has not been invited; she invited herself, to offer the EU divorce terms that she hopes it can’t refuse.
Why Florence? It is a question that has flummoxed many, including the Florentines, although insofar as No 10 has offered an answer it has sought to flatter them. Aides…

 Sir, Further to your reports and leading article (Sep 21), the people of Catalonia have the right to decide their own constitutional future. That should not be in dispute. Yet we see heavy-handed tactics used against a decision taken by a legitimate Catalan parliament, which is supported by 700 local mayors. Those in office, and who support the referendum, are now open to arrest and we hear election materials have been destroyed.
One can’t help but think that such antagonistic actions from Madrid may well trigger the political law of unintended consequences, by which the very situation that Madrid is determined to avoid comes to pass.
The right of self-determination is upheld by the UN. However, mature discussions on the arrangements for the referendum have…

Fresh US sanctions punish anyone who trades with Kim
September 22 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
North Korea threatened to explode a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean as Kim Jong-un insisted that Donald Trump’s threats of destruction justified his nuclear missile strategy and promised to “tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire”.
In the first ever such statement by a North Korean leader, Mr Kim promised Mr Trump “a corresponding, highest level of hardline countermeasure” after the US president threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea in defence of America or its allies.
Hours later in New York, Pyongyang’s foreign minister suggested that its response could be an atmospheric hydrogen bomb test, following the six underground tests already carried out in North Korea.
“In my opinion, perhaps we might consider a historic overground test of a hydrogen bomb over the…

ANALYSIS
Richard Lloyd Parry
Donald Trump’s handling of Korea is “arousing worldwide concern”. His speech in the United Nations was “unprecedented” and “rude”, and he should “exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to”.
As an analysis of the US president goes, it was stern, but conventional, the kind of thing one might find every week in the New Yorker or Washington Post.
But this was a critique by Kim Jong-un, in the first ever signed op-ed by a supreme leader of North Korea, carried today on a state news agency.
Mr Kim got a bit carried away further down his piece, referring to Mr Trump as a “rogue and a gangster” and a “mentally deranged US dotard”. But the thrust of his…

Catalonia will declare independence within 48 hours of a “yes” vote in next month’s controversial referendum, a leading regional politician said yesterday.
Raül Romeva, the Catalan regional government’s foreign minister, said the vote would be regarded as binding even if there was a low turnout, though he conceded that the new state would not be recognised internationally.
Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, is facing the country’s biggest political crisis since a failed coup by army officers in 1981. He has called the poll illegal and vowed to stop it taking place. The Spanish constitutional court has suspended the referendum while it considers an appeal by Mr Rajoy’s People’s Party, which says it contravenes the country’s 1978 constitution.
Mr Romeva, who has already set up…

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Millions of Mexicans watched and held their breath yesterday as the story of a young girl still alive beneath the rubble of a collapsed school briefly became a symbol of hope across the nation.
A painstaking rescue operation has been under way at the school in Mexico City since Tuesday afternoon when a powerful earthquake brought down scores of buildings across the capital and wrought destruction in towns south of the city.
As the death toll climbed to 273 and some 50 people were pulled alive from beneath the wreckage, the hope that children had survived in the ruins of the school was raised by reports of a trapped 12-year-old girl whose outstretched hand waved in response to calls from rescuers.
She was said to…

Gulf Arab states have taken the first steps towards recognising the state of Israel after the King of Bahrain, a close ally of Saudi Arabia, called for the boycott of the Jewish nation to be abandoned.
No Gulf state has recognised the state of Israel since it was created in 1948. In the region, only Egypt, Jordan and Turkey recognise the country.
However, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and its military presence in Iraq and Syria have led Gulf nations to unite against Tehran and try to bring Israel - a powerful enemy of the Islamic Republic - into the fold.
King Al Khalifa, the leader of Bahrain, first expressed his opposition to the Arab boycott of Israel during a meeting in February in Manama with two…

Angela Merkel’s main rival insisted he could yet become German chancellor as a survey showed record numbers of voters remained undecided ahead of Sunday’s election.
Martin Schulz, 61, lags far behind in opinion polls having failed to hang on to the surge that briefly saw him overtake Mrs Merkel when he became leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in February.
However, Mrs Merkel’s apparently easy path to victory seems to have turned off Germans by the thousand, and she has appealed to people to use their votes rather than allow populists to gain ground.
Germany’s three largest economic institutes said there could be an unexpectedly good result for Alternative for Germany (AfD), the nationalist party which has harnessed anger over the influx of more…

President Rouhani has vowed to strengthen Iran’s ballistic missile programme, defying American warnings that Tehran was breaching its nuclear pact with the West.
“We will not seek permission from anyone to defend our country,” Mr Rouhani said at a military parade marking the anniversary of the 1980 Iran-Iraq war. His remarks are likely to reinforce America’s belief that Iran has violated the terms of its nuclear deal with the West.
Earlier this week President Trump described the agreement as an “embarassment” to the US and hinted that he might pull out it unilaterally, adding that he had reached a decision on whether to recertify its terms. The Pentagon sees Iranian missile tests as a breach of the deal but Tehran insists that the rockets cannot…

Spanish police have arrested a man in connection with the double terrorist attack in August in which 16 people were killed and 130 injured.
The 24-year-old Moroccan allegedly purchased materials for explosives in his own name and provided vehicles for the terrorist cell.
The man was detained in Viñaros, near Castellon, southeastern Spain, by the Civil Guard.
The Spanish Interior Ministry said that the suspect was said to have had a “close relationship with various members of the cell and in particular Abdelbaki Es Satty”, the imam said to have masterminded the attack.
The man, who was not named, is being investigated for the purchase of materials that allowed the jihadists to make more than 100kg of TATP, the explosive known as the Mother of…

The shooting of one of the largest crocodiles ever seen in Australia has triggered a brutal fight for supremacy among the other males in the river system, increasing the danger they pose to humans.
The giant 17ft saltwater crocodile was discovered with a bullet in its head in Fitzroy River, near Rockhampton, in central Queensland on Thursday.
The dead male would have been a dominant male, patrolling large sections of the river and ruling over other males, said Michael Joyce, operations director at Queensland’s Department of Environment.
“People need to clearly understand the death of this animal has changed the balance of the crocodile population in the Fitzroy and we can expect increased aggressive activity by younger male crocodiles,” he said.
“They will be competing…

A federal investigation into Russian meddling in the US election has demanded documents from the White House for the first time, apparently homing in on President Trump’s dismissal of the FBI chief.
Mr Trump’s approval ratings have risen for three weeks in a row, the first time his popularity has shown such a sustained rise since he took office. However, investigations into his campaign’s links to Russia continue and Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation, has asked the White House for documents related to Mr Trump’s decision in May to dismiss James Comey, the former FBI director.
At the time he was sacked, Mr Comey was leading his own investigation into alleged Russian election meddling.
Mr Mueller is also interested in an Oval…

Facebook has banned a Rohingya militant group from its site, censuring it as a “dangerous organisation” as the refugee crisis in Burma continues to spill on to social media.
The site has become involved in the information war raging around the violence — denounced as ethnic cleansing by the United Nations — in Rakhine state.
Rohingya activists have used Facebook to report atrocities by government troops, while regime supporters have used it to denounce the Muslim minority as terrorists.
Facebook has been forced to intervene as the crisis has escalated in the past three weeks, reviewing its community standards in light of the counter-claims and allegations of hate speech by both sides.
The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa) has been listed as a dangerous organisation,…

Among the victims of the gang were a special forces officer, his wife and their two children, who were shot and stabbed to death in their car.
Inessa Tarverdieva and her daughter Viktoria, and Sergei Sinelnik and his wife Anastasia face up to 25 years in prison. They were found guilty of banditry, murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and theft of weapons.
Inessa Tarverdieva’s partner, Roman Podkopaev, 35, their leader, was killed when the band was detained four years ago in a gun battle with police in which one officer also died.

Berlin police are investigating an embarrassing burglary of Nazi artefacts from their own headquarters.
The German capital’s first line of law enforcement already had their hands full with crime without having to deal with a break-in at the offices in the Tempelhof district, and decided that humour was the best public response.
The haul included Germany’s top non-military medal, the Federal Cross of Merit, right, awarded to a former chief of Berlin police, Johannes Stumm.
There were also identification badges from the Gestapo and other wartime police decorations. These were in a collection in the force museum, the police social media team said.
The burglars had cut through a perimeter fence before breaking into the building and raiding the museum. Fortunately for the police they…

Warm, vivacious, unconventional, a lover of indie music and fine whisky, Jacinda Ardern has stormed the wintry tedium of New Zealand politics to the brink of becoming the world’s youngest freely elected leader.
The 37-year-old communications director who worked as a Whitehall policy adviser during the Blair years, has turned a dreary and seemingly predictable election upside down and is expected to bring nine years of conservative rule to an end this weekend.
“There’s a mood for change,” she told The Times. “There is a sentiment that after nine years there are things that New Zealanders just aren’t proud of. We like to think of ourselves as a prosperous nation that looks after its people.”

Iraqi armed forces began the final assault of their campaign to recapture Islamic State territory with a dawn attack on Hawija.
The town and its surrounding villages, a long-term hotspot of jihadist activity about 40 miles from Kirkuk, are entirely surrounded, including by Kurdish troops to the north.
It is one of the last two pockets of Isis-held territory in Iraq. The Iraqi Security Force (ISF) and pro-government militias moved on the other pocket, in western Anbar near the Syrian border, on Monday.
The army’s ability to fight on two fronts is a sign of how it has improved as a fighting force since it fled the Isis surge in summer 2014, Brigadier General Robert Sofge, a senior officer with the anti-Isis coalition Operation Inherent…

Riot police who worked for 14 hours to clear a makeshift camp near Dunkirk were startled to discover that some of the evicted migrants had been given accommodation in the same hotel.
The officers’ mood worsened when they were told that if anyone was to leave the hotel it would be them.
The blunder came to light when 22 officers returned to the Hôtel Première Classe in Rouvignies and a coach rented by the government to transport migrants away from the channel coast turned up as well. Inside were several dozen of the mainly Afghan and Iraqi Kurdish migrants who had been evicted by the officers earlier that day.
One of the officers told RTL radio: “How could anyone expect that to work out? You…

They gathered near a corner of Central Park to keep alive the old beloved language of their people by passing it on to a new member of their household. It was time for their dogs to learn Yiddish.
The Yiddish For Dogs class was convened by a community organisation that seeks to celebrate and preserve Jewish heritage and culture.
Studies show the language has fallen out of use in thousands of homes and there are fears that it could soon be limited to Orthodox enclaves. Workmen’s Circle has sought to counter the trend by organising Yiddish classes and retreats. Now it has broadened the drive to include pet owners who would like to shout at their dogs in the language of their parents and grandparents.

Abbott headbutted as gay marriage vote ‘gets ugly’Canberra Tony Abbott, who as prime minister decided to put legalisation of same-sex marriage to a public vote, said he was headbutted yesterday by a gay rights advocate.
Mr Abbott was attending a lunch for gay-marriage opponents in Hobart, Tasmania, when he was confronted in the street. He said that he suffered a swollen lip in the attack.
The incident is one of several cases of alleged violence and vote-rigging that have marred the postal ballot on whether Australia should legalise same-sex marriage. Australia and Ireland are the only countries to put the divisive…

Relief efforts in the Caribbean faced critical challenges in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria yesterday as Puerto Rico, a staging post for disaster operations, went from being part of the solution to part of the crisis.
As Maria rolled past the Dominican Republic and on towards the Turks and Caicos Islands, Puerto Rico, which was battered by the storm’s 155mph winds on Tuesday and Wednesday, found itself in dire need, having dispatched much of its emergency stockpiles to other stricken territories. “This is going to be a titanic effort. This is not the same island,” Jenniffer González- Colon, the US territory’s congressional representative, told CNBC.

Setbacks deal significant blow to recovery plans
September 21 2017, 5:00pm, The Times
Attempts to revive one of Britain’s biggest outsourcing companies were dealt a series of setbacks yesterday, hitting plans to clean up the business ahead of the arrival of a new chief executive.
Capita, which has been laid low by profit warnings and a collapse in its market value, suffered a further 12 per cent slide in its shares after the company:
• Was hit by industrial action by the Unite union over changes to its final-salary pension scheme, with six days of strikes planned in a fortnight that may affect contracts with the likes of Prudential and Royal London;
• Booked a £37 million provision for a likely penalty from the City regulator over its operation of a fund that left investors nursing heavy losses;

Securities and Exchange Commission reveals it was hacked,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.

Hackers infiltrated the computer network of America’s top markets watchdog, stealing private information that could have been used to make illegal trading profits.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said it discovered last month that a previously undisclosed hack of its systems in 2016 “may have provided the basis for illicit gain through trading”.
The admission is embarrassing for Jay Clayton, the commission’s chairman, who has said that public companies “have a clear obligation to disclose material information about cyber-risks and cyber-events”. The commission did not say why it had not previously admitted the breach.
The hack and possible insider trading activity were disclosed in a 5,000-word statement by Mr Clayton on Wednesday night. However, it contained little detail about the breach, focusing instead on the…

Deliveroo lost £129 million last year, more than it generated in sales, as the food delivery service saw its soaring revenues wiped out by the enormous costs involved in logistics, promotion and international expansion.
Annual turnover at the company, which is backed by some of the world’s leading venture capitalists, grew by 610 per cent from £18.1 million in 2015 to £128.6 million last year, its latest accounts show.
However, the cost of delivering food to customers was £127.5 million, resulting in a gross profit of only £1.1 million — a margin of less than 0.9 per cent.
Administrative expenses, including the cost of promoting the service, ballooned from £28.8 million in 2015 to £142.2 million. Pre-tax losses widened by 330 per cent, from £30.1…

With $1.5 trillion of assets officially registered in their jurisdiction, the British Virgin Islands’ financial authorities yesterday moved to calm fears that the combined effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria might pose a risk to investors’ offshore holdings.
BVI Finance, the British overseas territory’s marketing and promotion agency, said that disaster recovery plans were in place that meant despite the terrible damage and the loss of life on the islands, there had been little impact on financial operations.
“For the international business and finance centre, Hurricane Maria caused minimal disruption with many firms able to continue providing key services to clients throughout,” Lorna Smith, the interim executive director, said: “Fundamentally, despite recent events the BVI remains open for business now and for the future.”

The London market struggled for direction earlier amid warnings that stocks would be dragged lower by “increasingly choppy” economic conditions over the coming months.
The FTSE 100 gained just 6.3 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 7,270.2 this morning as investors waited for Theresa May to deliver a much-anticipated speech on Brexit in Florence. Reports that the prime minister was preparing to signal a so-called “soft” departure from the European Union lifted the pound.
Analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove warned this morning of the “increasingly challenging” outlook for London-listed small and mid-cap companies. Such stocks were “more leveraged to the domestic economy than their larger brethren and can expect to see their earnings more acutely impacted by any future economic disappointment in the UK,” they…

Apple shares have fallen sharply since it unveiled its latest iPhone last week, breaking a pattern established in seven of the last ten launches, and are on track for their worst post-announcement performance since 2013.
The company’s shares are down 4.6 per cent since its big launch event last week of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, a third-generation smartwatch and a new Apple TV device.
That compares with rises of 3, 4.1 and 6.1 per cent in the weeks after its flagship product launches in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, according to data from Dow Jones.
The smartphones have gone on sale in Britain today and crowds outside shops have not been as big as at past launches.

Not another end of an era, surely. As if we haven’t had enough already this week, without Richard Cousins getting in on the act. What’s the Compass catering boss up to? Trying to upstage Mark Carney’s first-interest-rates-rise-in-a-decade routine — even if no one will believe that till they see it? Or the Fed’s Janet Yellen, with her QE-unravelling caper, signalling the end of the financial crisis? And now up rocks Mr Cousins, bringing down the meat cleaver on his 11 years in the Compass kitchen, so reminding everyone of an even bigger crisis.
Yes, turkey twizzlers. Who can forget all that — when Jamie Oliver was running the country and kids looked forward to school lunches, before they were force-fed grass or some other herbivore concoction.…

The other day there was a large funeral in my home town of Wolverhampton for a 52-year-old man who died suddenly in August. According to the local paper hundreds of people gathered at his former workplace to pay their respects, leaving 300 bunches of flowers and 500 written tributes while doing so. A “sea” of more than 2,000 people were photographed gathering for his funeral. Then, after the eulogy had been given, the crowd erupted into spontaneous applause.
Who was he? A former footballer for Wolverhampton Wanderers? A local politician? No, he was Raj Kumar, who “just” ran the Ashmore Park Hardware shop for more than 30 years. He died after collapsing in his shop and according to the tributes left for him the reason…

One of the world’s leading credit agencies has cut China’s sovereign rating, warning that the second largest economy could be in for a bumpy ride as a domestic credit boom raised the risk to the country’s financial stability.
Standard & Poor’s downgraded China’s long-term rating from AA- to A+ with a warning that the huge swelling in local and offshore debt that has helped to fuel growth could leave a nasty aftertaste as the economy slows.
It followed a cut in May by Moody’s, a rival rating agency. Fitch, another credit rating agency, last cut China’s sovereign rating four years ago.
Explaining the decision, S&P said it reflected its analysis of the “prolonged period of strong credit growth” which it warned had increased the country’s…

Confidential minutes from a high-level City meeting in 2007 raise questions about the ruling this week by the Financial Reporting Council that KPMG was “reasonable” in vouching for the health of the soon-to-fail bank HBOS.
With the credit crunch in full swing, a meeting of investment chiefs and senior accounting professionals at the offices of Schroders two weeks before Christmas 2007 heard how the FRC was “fully aware that there might be ‘going concern’ problems” at UK banks.
Yet the FRC, the main regulator for UK accountancy firms, this week cleared KPMG of any failings when in February 2008 the accountants judged HBOS to have made £5.5 billion of profits and to be a going concern. The FRC ruled that market conditions at the time…

Headline pre-tax profits rose to £528 million in the year to the end of July, up from £451 million the previous year, on revenue up 11 per cent to £3.28 billion. Profits beat analysts forecasts of £522 million but revenues were slightly lower than the £3.3 billion expected.

Co-op Group has sold its last remaining stake in the struggling Co-op Bank as its food business continues to grow and outperform the market.
In an end of an era for the mutual, Steve Murrells, group chief executive, said it had disposed of its 1 per cent stake for £5 million because it was “the logical and right thing to do”. The Co-op’s stake in the bank has been falling over the years following a rescue by hedge funds in 2013 as well as a £700 million recapitalisation earlier this year.
He said the bank will keep the Co-op brand assuming it maintains the ethical policy in its articles of association and until 2020 bank customers can still become members of the Co-operative.

September 21 2017, 9:00am, The Times
Richard Cousins is to leave Compass Group after eleven years, having helped to transform the fortunes of a company that was once on its knees.
The FTSE 100 chief executive said he would step down as head of the world’s largest contract caterer in March and hand over six months after that to Dominic Blakemore, chief operating officer for Europe.
Mr Blakemore has worked at Compass since 2012 and will become deputy chief executive from next month and chief executive next April.
News of Mr Cousins’s departure sent shares in Compass down 2.5 per cent yesterday to close at £15.71 as the City digested the news that a chief executive with a strong reputation for making money for investors was leaving.
When Mr Cousins left…

Dorothy Thompson, one of the few female chief executives running a large UK-listed company, is to step down as head of Drax after 12 years.
Ms Thompson, who helped to steer the FTSE 250-listed operator of Britain’s biggest coal-fired power station towards a future based on renewable energy, will leave the company at the end of the year. Will Gardiner, the chief financial officer, will take over as chief executive from January 1.
Shares in Drax, which generates about 7 per cent of UK electricity and runs the coal and biomass-fired power plant at Selby in North Yorkshire, closed down 2 per cent at 308.9p yesterday.
Philip Cox, chairman of Drax, praised Ms Thompson for transforming the business and leaving the group in “excellent shape”,…

CRH picked up 64p to £27.19 after unveiling a £2.6 billion acquisition as it continues to build its empire. The Dublin-based construction materials group has reached an agreement to buy Ash Grove Cement in a bid to strengthen its American operation.
Ash Grove is based in Kansas and dates back 135 years. CRH, which is its largest customer, expects to complete its takeover before the end of the year. Even before the deal, the company was already the biggest manufacturer of concrete products in North America.
Responding to the purchase, analysts at Davy noted that CRH was “investing in a business where it has significant synergy and growth potential, which could improve returns even more”.
The company towered over many of its blue-chip peers, which…

Johnson Matthey has announced plans to spend £200 million expanding its battery material business, as it seeks to tap into the booming global market for electric cars.
The cash will be used to build a factory in the Far East to meet Chinese demand for electric vehicles and beef up its battery research operation in Britain, Robert MacLeod, the company’s chief executive, said.
The factory, which is likely to be in China, will produce about 10,000 tonnes of cathode materials a year, enough for 60,000-70,000 cars.
Shares in the company, which manufactures chemicals, catalysts used in petrol and diesel engines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, rose by nearly 15 per cent yesterday.
Mr MacLeod said the new plant would generate revenues of £200 million to £300…

New rules requiring companies to publish the difference between what male and female employees earn was supposed to help to close Britain’s 18.1 per cent gender pay gap.
However, as it became the first FTSE 100 company to publish its figures under the new rules, SSE, the utility group, admitted yesterday that the difference had widened in the last year.
The household energy supplier said that its median gender pay gap of 19.3 per cent in 2016-17 was higher than the 18.7 per cent gap in 2015-16.
The figures highlight the difficulties some companies seem to face establishing gender pay equality and follows a public outcry after revelations in July that male presenters at the BBC were twice as likely as their female colleagues to…

The FTSE 250 company, which has been restructuring and offloading unwanted businesses, posted a strong performance across all divisions and an increased dividend that helped to reassure investors. Kier said revenue rose 3 per cent to £4.1 billion in the year to the end of June, propelling the company back into the black.
Statutory profit came in at £26 million, compared with a loss of £35 million the year before. On an underlying basis, profits rose 8 per cent to £126 million, excluding exceptional items of £75 million, such as from the closure of its international construction businesses…

Rio Tinto will return to shareholders the proceeds of selling a chunk of its Australian coal business via a $2.5 billion share buyback.
The move will raise its total buybacks this year to $4 billion. The move follows the sale of Coal & Allied, its New South Wales business, to Yancoal Australia, a Chinese-backed company, for $2.7 billion. Yancoal is immediately selling a stake in the business to Glencore.
The miner, listed in both London and Australia, said it would repurchase $560 million of shares in Sydney and the rest in London in coming months.
Rio said it was paying the biggest dividend in its history, worth $2 billion, in August after doubling first-half profit.

Lawyers are facilitating “aggressive” tax avoidance schemes that flirt with being illegal, the profession’s watchdog said yesterday as it warned of a crackdown on sharp practices.
Regulators have become concerned at what they describe as Revenue & Customs repeatedly moving the goalposts regarding schemes that are designed to be tax efficient.
The Solicitors Regulation Authority said that the General Anti-Abuse Rule 2013 was designed to cover schemes that “achieve a favourable tax result that parliament did not anticipate when it introduced the tax rules in question”.
Tax officials have said they will take action against abusive tax avoidance schemes and indicated that they will start challenging arrangements that are not covered by the 2013 rules.

Rentokil has announced a replacement for Chris Geoghegan, the non-executive director who resigned on Monday after getting caught up in a scandal that caused the public relations firm Bell Pottinger to collapse this month.
The pest control company confirmed that Richard Burrows, a non-executive director and former Bank of Ireland governor, will take over as chairman of Rentokil’s remuneration committee and senior independent director.
Mr Geoghegan’s resignation followed shortly after his role in Bell Pottinger’s now infamous work for the Gupta family in South Africa emerged. The PR agency was accused of inflaming racial tensions over its work for the tycoons, who deny profiting from a close relationship with President Zuma of South Africa.

Daimler is to begin making electric cars in the US with a $1 billion overhaul of its Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama.
The German carmaker will build a facility near the plant to assemble battery systems for an all-electric sports utility vehicle that is expected to enter production early in the next decade.
The investment forms part of Daimler’s plan to spend $11 billion on expanding its capability to build electric vehicles around the world. The company said at the end of last year that it wanted to electrify all its vehicle portfolio, offering 50 fully or partly electric vehicles by 2022.

MPs are set to investigate whether the spread of electric vehicles could crash Britain’s electricity grid.
The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee said it will examine the challenges that electric cars pose to infrastructure and what actions will be needed to support the industry’s growth. Critics say the mass take-up of electric cars could overload the power network, forcing the network’s owners to invest large sums reinforcing it.
“The arrival of electric vehicles on the mass market creates substantial challenges for the electricity grid, which must balance the additional energy demand created by electric vehicles whilst providing secure and reliable electricity supplies for the country,” the committee said.
It added that there was a lack of evidence on the extent and type of developments…

One of the country’s leading specialist lenders to buy-to-let property investors has said it will accelerate its plans to become a mainstream bank as part of a reorganisation of its business aimed at diversifying away from home lending.
The Paragon Group of Companies said it would henceforth be known as Paragon Banking Group, as it transferred all its staff to a new holding company three years after gaining permission from the Bank of England to open a deposit-taking arm.
Paragon said in a statement that all of its lending and operating business together with the greater part of its loan portfolio had been moved over to Paragon Bank as it looked to become a business largely funded by retail deposits.

The halfway figures from Capita were always going to be horribly messy. The company was forced to restate its figures for 2016 because of changes to accounting standards that were aimed to reflect the short-term impact of long-term contracts.
The company announced this month that on the new basis profits for last year would have been almost a third lower. This cleared the way for interim results that were drawn up using the new accounting standards.
They did, however, contain large write-offs from exiting businesses and other provisions. These include the cost of selling its asset services side in the summer for £888 million, a deal which took the pressure off the balance sheet and probably obviated the need for a rights issue.

Google is to assume full control of its Pixel smartphone programme with the purchase of the division of HTC that co-develops the handset.
The technology giant will acquire intellectual property and 2,000 employees from the Taiwanese electronics company in a $1.1 billion deal as it competes with Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy and growing Chinese manufacturers such as Xiaomi.
Android, Google’s mobile operating system, has a market share of nearly 90 per cent. However, Google has struggled to gain a foothold in the smartphone hardware market, with the Pixel accounting for less than 1 per cent of handsets sold.
Rick Osterloh, who runs Google’s hardware division, said of the HTC deal: “We’re excited to see what we can do together as one team.”

Revolution refuses to go clubbing,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Revolution Bars has been accused of dismissing a merger offer from Britain’s biggest nightclub operator “out of hand” as it moves forward with Stonegate’s £101.5 million takeover.
Deltic Group, formerly Luminar, said that Stonegate “undervalues” Revolution, which floated in 2015.
“Revolution’s board has rejected Deltic’s merger proposal out of hand and has seen no merit in pursuing merger discussions or conducting any due diligence on Deltic’s business or plans for a combined business,” Deltic said in a statement.
Stonegate, which owns the Slug and Lettuce and Walkabout brands, is offering 203p per share in cash, valuing Revolution at £101.5 million.
Deltic’s preferred option is an all-paper merger which would maintain its listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Revolution shares closed up 1½p at 210p.

Oil prices remained above the $56 level last night ahead of today’s meeting in Vienna of Opec members and other large producers including Russia to agree an extension on production limits to reduce the global supply glut. Many analysts expect the world’s largest producers to extend the deal that currently lasts until March, although there are fears that prices at current levels could encourage some countries to boost output. In New York last night the price of Brent crude was 0.1 per cent higher at $56.37 a barrel.

Eon to scrap controversial standard variable energy tariff,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Eon has announced plans to scrap its standard variable tariff, in a first for the Big Six energy giants.
The German-owned group said yesterday it would put all customers onto fixed tariffs if they agreed to fit a smart meter in their home that measures energy consumption in real-time.
The one-year fixed tariff will have no exit fee and customers will have the option to “roll over” on to the latest version of a fixed-term contract.
The Big Six — British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, Eon, Npower and EDF Energy — have traditionally used discounted fixed tariffs to entice new customers to sign up, but once their deals expire after a year or 18 months they are pushed onto costly standard variable tariffs.

The Game Daily Tactics Special: rise in the 3-4-2-1 formation is leading to a decline in traditional attacking midfielders
In December, Antonio Conte did something audacious — and significant. He sanctioned the sale, to Chinese club Shanghai SIPG, of Oscar: a key member of Chelsea’s title-winning team of 2014-15, a Brazil regular, and a player, at 25 years old, of peak-career age.
He did so despite having an extremely small number of first-team players for a title-contending side, and despite the fact that Oscar was an important part of a large Lusophone contingent in the Chelsea dressing room, also including David Luiz, Willian, Diego Costa and the reserve goalkeeper Eduardo. But Conte had seen which way football’s tactical sands were shifting and come to a realisation: the traditional No 10 was dying.
For a period beginning with the emergence of 4-2-3-1 as football’s most…

Warren Gatland is expected to confront Seán O’Brien over his searing criticism of the British & Irish Lions coaching team.
O’Brien, who played all three Tests in the drawn series with New Zealand, said that the Lions would have won 3-0 with better coaching and he was especially critical of Rob Howley, the attack coach. The Times understands that there are players from the Lions squad who agree with O’Brien’s assessment. Billy Vunipola, who missed the tour through injury but whose brother, Mako, started all three Tests, claimed that the Lions would have won 3-0 if Eddie Jones had been in charge.
However, Gatland and his coaching team of Howley, Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree, Steve Borthwick and Neil Jenkins have been stung by O’Brien’s criticism.…

Marcus Smith, the 18-year-old Harlequins fly-half, is included again having had his first taste of a senior England camp in Teddington during the summer.
Eddie Jones described Smith as “the apprentice” and sought to calm the excitement surrounding the rookie, who has played just 196 minutes of Aviva Premiership rugby, by saying that he would spend most of the camp polishing George Ford’s boots.

Dan Ashworth, the Football Association’s technical director, has been dragged into the Mark Sampson controversy after it was confirmed that he sat on his interview panel and had been made aware of the safeguarding investigation into the sacked England women’s manager.
It has also emerged that part of the £80,000 settlement that the FA agreed to pay Eni Aluko after she alleged bullying and discrimination by Sampson has been withheld because of a legal wrangle over whether she may have breached an agreement in recent interviews over the case.
Ashworth is understood to have not seen the full report of the investigation into allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Sampson towards young women at the Bristol Academy team until last weekend. However, FA sources have confirmed…

As press briefings go, Wednesday’s sacking of Mark Sampson was chastening for the Football Association leadership — especially Martin Glenn, the chief executive — in a way that reminded some of us of an excruciating hour at Old Trafford in November 2003. That was another day when the FA got lost in a moral maze.
We gathered to hear that Alan Smith, the Leeds United striker, had been banished from the England squad after he had been questioned by police for throwing a plastic bottle into a crowd. Mark Palios, one of Glenn’s predecessors, was determined to set the highest standards. Smith was out.
When, in his place, James Beattie was summoned, it was swiftly pointed out by a helpful journalist that the Southampton forward…

A lot of talented female footballers will play their first league matches of the new season this weekend.

The fate of women’s league football has always been inextricably linked to the fortunes of the England team. If more than four million viewers tune in to see the Lionesses in action, then surely some of that interest — passion, even — will seep into the Women’s Super League (WSL)? Success breeds success.

Mauricio Pochettino has revealed he prepared for tomorrow’s London derby at West Ham United by taking the Tottenham Hotspur players and staff out for dinner and footing the bill of around £10,000.
The Argentinian took 50 members of his staff and squad to the exclusive Beast establishment off Oxford Street on Wednesday in an alternative to training.
Tottenham players ate £100-a-head meals of Spanish steak and Norwegian crab and also enjoyed £160-a-bottle wine from Argentina and Pochettino believes the exercise is the ideal preparation for the fixture.
“We had a dinner in a restaurant in London with all the staff and players that I invited, of course,” he said. “I paid the bill at the end, Daniel Levy did not ask me to. That is…

Romelu Lukaku has asked Manchester United supporters to stop singing a racist song about the size of his penis and urged them to “respect each other”. The striker’s plea was released through United’s official Twitter account to 14.4 million followers after the song was heard during the Carabao Cup victory over Burton Albion on Wednesday.
A small group of fans in the Stretford End were heard chanting the offending words in defiance of requests from the club. It prompted United and Lukaku, who joined the club in a £90 million transfer from Everton in the summer, to act and the forward called on supporters to move on.
“Great backing since I joined #MUFC. Fans have meant well with their songs but let’s move on together.…

Chelsea and Atletico Madrid agree £57m fee for Diego Costa,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
Premier League
September 21 2017, 5:00pm, The Times
Chelsea are celebrating what they regard as a victory in their protracted attempts to sell Diego Costa after agreeing a deal with Atletico Madrid that will see him return to the club on loan as a precursor to a permanent transfer worth £57.2 million.
Under the terms of the agreement Chelsea will not subsidise any of his wages during the loan period or pay Costa a loyalty bonus, which he had been seeking after spending three years at Stamford Bridge.
The 28-year-old must pass a medical to complete the transfer but has been in Madrid for the past week after spending most of the summer in Brazil. That procedure is regarded as a formality.
Costa will not be allowed to register to play for Atletico…

Premier League clubs expect digital giants such as Amazon and Facebook to bid for streaming rights in next year’s auction, Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has revealed.
Competition from such companies would pose a big threat to Sky and BT Sport’s hold over the domestic TV rights because of their massive financial power, and could also bring another big rise in the clubs’ broadcast income.
Facebook failed with a $600 million (about £442 million) bid for cricket’s Indian Premier League’s overseas rights, and the digital companies could bid for the domestic or overseas rights to English football’s top tier.
The existing three-year rights are worth a total of £8.6 billion and clubs expect the biggest increase to come from the overseas rights, which are…

Star of the week Rio Ferdinand inevitably got some flak for venturing into boxing. Who does he think he is, bringing shame to a sport where men threaten to rip off each other’s heads, before staging mock fights at press conferences and selling tickets with the frenzy of PT Barnum on speed/commission. Then a silly fight between a has-been and a non-boxer is dubbed the biggest thing sport had seen since the Bearded Lady took on the Elephant Man at Top Trumps.
Boxing is a great sport but is also indefensible and daft. Last weekend came the fight to restore the sport – Golovkin v Alvarez – but alas it was a farce because one of the judges was watching the other side. Rio, a decent person…

Henry winter meets Gareth Ainsworth
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
In the brutal trade of management, where supporters clamour for results and heads, and where bookies run “Sacktember” races, endurance deserves even more respect. This weekend, Gareth Ainsworth celebrates five years in charge of Wycombe Wanderers, putting him fourth on the list of longest-serving managers behind Arsène Wenger, of Arsenal, Exeter City’s Paul Tisdale and Jim Bentley, of Morecambe.
Ainsworth respects those three, and all his peers, for their commitment. “It’s an obsession,” he says. “There is stress. I take things home. Donna [his wife] tells me, ‘You can’t be like this at home just because you’ve had a bad result’. I’ve dreamt about substitutions, formations and telling someone they’re not playing. I’ve had health checks recently. Thank goodness, everything came back A-OK.

Jürgen Klopp believes expectations of Liverpool have been heightened by the “flying” starts to the season made by both Manchester clubs.
The Liverpool manager also sought to apply perspective to his team’s results and claimed that the forensic analysis of performances had suggested that they were “the worst team in the league.”
A patchy run was extended to four games without a victory as a much-changed team lost 2-0 in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday away to Leicester City, who also rested key personnel and host Liverpool again in the Premier League tomorrow evening.
“You really think there would be 1 per cent of a reason I would panic?” Klopp said. “Do you think any team in the world loves playing against us in this…

September 21 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
Arsène Wenger says there is no “disguised attitude” involved in his policy of using Alexis Sánchez as a midweek player in the cup competitions rather than a Premier League starter.
The Chile forward wanted to join Manchester City for £60 million on transfer deadline day but the deal fell through when Arsenal failed to negotiate a £92 million deal to replace him with the Monaco midfielder Thomas Lemar.
Sánchez is in the final year of his contract and the chances of him renewing with Arsenal appear remote. The 28-year-old played 90 minutes in last night’s 1-0 win over Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup third round and played the full game against Cologne last week but has been on the bench for the two previous…

The Game Daily: Rangers must prove they are moving forward in the Old Firm derby
Imagine Celtic and Rangers as two neighbours permanently tuned in to what the other is up to, each with an ear pressed up against a glass on either side of a dividing wall.
Celtic have won six consecutive league titles, have posted a 74 per cent growth in revenue to a record £90.6 million, and just shared a stage with Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Rangers haven’t won a major trophy for six years and were knocked out of Europe two months ago by Uefa plankton from Luxembourg. Glasgow’s giants are in different places. Yet they still remain inseparable, forever psychologically tethered by the need to master each other.
The first Old Firm game of the season is at Ibrox on Saturday. Brendan Rodgers…

For those wondering if this weekend’s inaugural Laver Cup, contested between six-player teams representing Europe and the rest of the world, is just another exhibition event in a packed tennis calendar, Rafael Nadal issued a defiant riposte yesterday.
“It is not an exhibition at all,” Nadal said. “We are here to try our best. I woke up today at 4am to practise. I don’t practise before an exhibition match normally.”
It was exactly the answer you would expect from a man being paid an appearance fee, believed to be in the high six figures, to participate in an event that is the brainchild of his arch-rival, Roger Federer. But, although there is no prize money or ranking points at stake in Prague, there is undeniably…

Lord’s (third day of four): Middlesex (20pts) beat Lancashire (3) by 36 runs
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
By his own admission, Steven Finn has had a far-from-consistent season. Indeed, he had not taken five wickets in an innings since playing for England against Australia at Edgbaston two summers ago.
Here, though, he was rhythmical, quick and expressive, as he needed to be in the absence of Toby Roland-Jones. His figures of eight for 79, his best at Lord’s, sank Lancashire and gave Middlesex a significant chance of avoiding relegation.
In addition, Finn enhanced his prospects of touring Australia this winter. The unforgiving existence of a professional sportsman is such that he will be more likely to go if Roland-Jones, who had a further scan on his side strain yesterday, does not.
8-79 Finn’s figures were his second-best in first-class cricket following 9-37 v Worcestershire in 2010
26 Months since his last five-wicket haul in first-class cricket — in the Ashes at Edgbaston in July 2015
The first, on Wednesday, was inconclusive, and the results today will…

A thrilling finish is in prospect at Headingley today, where Yorkshire will resume on 56 for three, needing another 119 runs to beat Warwickshire and maintain their advantage over Somerset in the battle to avoid relegation from Division One.
Steven Patterson was Yorkshire’s outstanding bowler with a season’s-best four for 46, including the wickets of Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, as the already-relegated visitors were bowled out for 251. The Warwickshire off spinner Jeetan Patel dismissed Alex Lees and Kraigg Brathwaite before the close to leave the outcome in the balance.
Another exciting conclusion is possible at Wantage Road, where Nottinghamshire will begin the final day on 107 for three, needing another 207 to beat Northamptonshire and confirm that both themselves and Worcestershire will be…

Kia Oval (third day of four): Somerset, with six second-innings wickets in hand, are 51 runs behind Surrey

The dramatic events on the other side of the Thames were a body blow to Somerset’s chances of avoiding relegation, but rain after tea at least gave them a glimmer of hope of salvaging a draw from this match. That could prove crucial if Yorkshire lose to already-relegated Warwickshire, but even then Somerset would likely have to beat Middlesex next week with a healthy tally of bonus points, if they are to stay up.
Surrey enhanced their own hopes of finishing as runners-up with some hard-nosed batting and bowling. Rikki Clarke capped a fine all-round performance with a bruising innings of 50, including ten fours, mostly in an important seventh-wicket stand of 99 in 26 overs with Kumar Sangakkara. That gave Surrey a fourth batting…

Like El Dorado, it is no more than a rumour. There seems a certain kind of madness afoot. For all the talk of crowd size in the recent game in Philadelphia, the holy grail is television money. Alex Corbisiero, the former British & Irish Lion, reckons rugby has “a huge market”. He is NBC’s analyst. It would be news if he said anything else.
But Corbisiero is not alone. Martin Anayi, the Guinness Pro14 chief executive, believes the addition of a North American side to the league is “a matter of when and not if”, irrespective of whether…

Racing authorities in Britain may review the rules surrounding the use of pacemakers after concern was expressed at the way the St Leger, the final classic of the season, was run at Doncaster on Saturday.
The Anvil was one of four runners from Aidan O’Brien’s Ballydoyle stable competing for the £700,000 prize money. The 66-1 chance burst into an early lead and at one stage had a ten-length advantage before quickly running out of steam and trailing in 60 lengths behind the winner.
It ensured that the race, which was won by the O’Brien-trained 3-1 favourite Capri, was run at a relentless pace. His two other participants, Douglas Macarthur and Venice Beach, provided cover for Capri in a manner not unlike the peleton in a…

The Inside Line
The manner in which the St Leger unfolded at Doncaster on Saturday has once again raised the question of how pacemaking should be regarded within the parameters of racing.
Let’s start with the rules of racing. On the one hand they allow for pacemakers, on the other they stipulate that a horse has to be ridden on its merits to achieve a best possible place. Are the two generally reconcilable? Therein lies the paradox.
Rule 57.1 states: A rider must not make a manoeuvre in a race in the interests of another horse in common ownership or under common control or from the same stable or team, whether or not such a manoeuvre causes interference or causes his horse to fail to achieve its best…

Tranmere sign blocked by FA,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
The FA covered up a sign at Tranmere Rovers’ Prenton Park reading ‘Super White Army’ when Mark Sampson’s England women’s team played there on Tuesday evening.
The slogan is intended to show support for Vanarama National League side Tranmere, who play in white.
But the FA had the sign covered when the ground hosted England’s 6-0 World Cup qualifying win over Russia, apparently for fear it may be misinterpreted following allegations of racism made against Sampson by the England striker Eni Aluko.
Lucy Bronze, the England defender, had tweeted a picture of Prenton Park with the sign visible before the match, stressing ‘Super White Army’ was a reference to Tranmere Rovers.
The FA covered the sign shortly afterwards but declined to explain why they had…

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
If there is one thing that Luke Campbell is not concerned about as he faces the biggest test of his career, it is whether he can cope with the pressure. When he won a gold medal in the fevered atmosphere of the 2012 London Olympics, Campbell discovered that he performs pretty well when it matters and that could be crucial tomorrow when he bids to become a world champion.
Only two boxers who won Olympic gold for Great Britain — James DeGale and Anthony Joshua — have gone on to win world titles as a professional, and Campbell could scarcely have picked a tougher route for himself than facing Jorge Linares, a three-weight world champion, for the WBA lightweight title at the Forum in Los Angeles.…

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Despite their trials and tribulations this year, St Helens are all but 80 minutes from another Grand Final appearance at Old Trafford on October 7.
Of 30 Betfred Super League games, they have lost 13, dispensed with Keiron Cunningham, a club legend, as coach and gone out on a limb in appointing a little-known Australian in Justin Holbrook, whose five months as head coach have been about gradual improvement and instilling belief.
Victory last night, barring some freakish last round outcomes, looks to have maintained St Helens’ record of reaching the play-offs every year since their introduction in 1998, with a semi-final trip to Castleford Tigers, the leaders, or Leeds Rhinos next week dependent on results elsewhere.
Wakefield Trinity were finally eliminated from the top…

September 21 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
Brian Cookson has failed in his attempt to be re-elected as president of the International Cycling Union (UCI) after being emphatically beaten by a rival who has promised to ban corticosteroids from the sport.
David Lappartient, of France, beat him by 37 votes to eight in the election in Bergen, Norway, in what was almost certainly the biggest election defeat of an incumbent president of an international sporting federation. Lappartient, 44, had promised radical changes including banning the out-of-competition use of corticosteroids, the drug taken by Sir Bradley Wiggins under a therapeutic use exemption to treat a pollen allergy, in cycling.
Lappartient also says that he will ban the use of Tramadol, the powerful but legal painkiller that the British cyclist Jonathan Tiernan-Locke claimed was…

Catriona Matthew has spoken of her pride in being asked to lead the Europe Solheim Cup team in her native Scotland after being appointed captain of the side that will contest the biennial event at Gleneagles in September 2019.
Although she was widely expected to be given the role, the appointment was only confirmed yesterday. The most successful female golfer that Scotland has produced, Matthew, 48, was named as a vice-captain to Annika Sorenstam at last month’s tournament in Iowa. The the United States won 16½-11½ to retain the trophy and she ended up making her ninth playing appearance and contributing three points, albeit in a defeat.
Her career tally of 22 Solheim Cup points is third on the all-time European list, with only Laura…

Jordan Spieth remains on course to win a second FedEx Cup title and a $10 million (about £7.4 million) bonus after the opening day of the Tour Championship at East Lake in Atlanta.
Spieth recovered from a shaky start to record a 67, three under par, that left him three shots off the lead held by his fellow American, Kyle Stanley.
Any of the 30 players in the season-ending event can theoretically win the massive pay day, but only the top five in the standings are assured of doing so by claiming the £1.1 million first prize.
Stanley began the week 22nd in the standings and needs to win and see a lot of other results go his way to claim the FedEx Cup title.…

September 22 2017, 9:00am, The Times
Rory McIlroy has reignited the debate about combining the PGA Tour and the European Tour, claiming that the American competition should just buy out its European counterpart.
McIlroy’s comments are likely to irritate Keith Pelley, the chief executive of the European Tour, who may meet McIlroy next week at the British Masters in Newcastle. McIlroy will be playing in Newcastle because he failed to qualify to compete for the huge payday on offer at the Tour Championships this weekend in Atlanta.
“The World Tour – it’s going to happen one day, and I think it has to,” McIlroy told the No Laying Up podcast. “To have all these tours competing against each other, and having to change dates, it’s counter-productive. I think everyone has to come…

Teddy Taylor played into the trope of the “hang ’em and flog ’em” Tory with ease. A man of strident views, he campaigned for the restoration of the death penalty, opposed the relaxation of Sunday trading laws, described industrial action as an “exercise in anarchy” and demanded that strikers be flogged. Bernard Levin suggested that this Glasgow-born MP would regard Ivan the Terrible as soft on law and order were the Russian tsar to be home secretary.
Yet the main target of Taylor’s venom was Europe, something he campaigned against with almost religious fervour. From the outset he opposed Britain’s membership of the EEC, an organisation he regarded as a hotbed of socialism, itself something to be despised. He watched with abject horror as it…

The world’s richest woman who inherited the L’Oréal cosmetics empire, but spent her later years locked in a bitter court battle with her daughter
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
With an estimated fortune of £33 billion, according to Forbes magazine, Liliane Bettencourt was the richest woman in the world. Her massive wealth was the result of her inheritance of the French cosmetics giant, L’Oréal, which had been founded by her father in 1909.
Businesswoman, socialite and philanthropist, Bettencourt cut a glamorous figure — she once claimed that Mao Zedong had taken a shine to her — though she shunned attention and rarely gave interviews. In the last years of her life, however, she faced intense scrutiny and unwelcome publicity as France became captivated by a series of personal, family and political dramas.
The dramas began in December 2007 when, a month after the death of her father, Bettencourt’s only child, her daughter, Françoise, began…

Russian officer who spared the world from nuclear war when, acting on instinct, he correctly judged a false alarm
September 21 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
A little after midnight on September 26, 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a 44-year-old Russian military scientist, made a decision based on instinct. It prevented the outbreak of a nuclear war.
As with any other shift, Petrov, a lieutenant-colonel in the Soviet Union’s Air Defence Forces, had arrived at his secret bunker, Serpukhov-15, near Moscow an hour early to prepare for his 8pm start. That night he was covering for a sick colleague and was responsible for monitoring early-warning satellites positioned over the US. Suddenly alarms started ringing and all in the bunker believed they were under attack.
“The siren howled,” Petrov recalled. “But I just sat there for a few seconds, staring at the big, back-lit, red screen with the word ‘launch’ on it.”

September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Today is the autumn equinox, best known for having equal hours of day and night. It’s not exactly equal, though, because there are a few extra minutes of daylight thanks to an optical illusion created by the atmosphere. When the sun is hidden just under the horizon at dawn and dusk, its rays are bent upwards by the atmosphere. This makes the sun appear higher than it really is.
The equinox also marks a number of other milestones — the point when the sun appears overhead at noon at the Earth’s equator, the sun rises due east and sets due west except for the North and South Poles, and the year’s fastest sunrises and sunsets. The equinox is also usually thought of as halfway between the…

The essential point about the advance of the British Army beyond Ypres on Thursday is that it wrested from the enemy much ground which they were determined never to relinquish. For the Germans there is no question of strategic withdrawals in this portion of Belgium. From the sea to Lille they regard their present front as vital, and their troops are ordered to hold all points to the last gasp. The object of our own Higher Command is clear enough. We are fighting to compel the Germans to loosen their grip upon the strip of Belgian coast which has become the key to their whole scheme of defence in the Western theatre. The heart of their resistance lies in the series of low ridges which…

The winner of this week’s bottle of champagne is Philip Tonge of Bolton for his picture (above): “My giant continental rabbit Lofthouse enjoying the football. The only problem is his huge ears hamper my view of the screen.”
The winner of the Sylvia & Terry fine Kentish handmade chocolates (sylviaandterry.com) is Pamela Shaw of Accrington, Lancashire:
“A patient attends hospital to see a specialist. The man comes into the room accompanied by a dog and a cat. The dog carefully walks all over the patient as he is lying on the examination couch. Next, the cat jumps up and closely scrutinises the patient. When the patient asks the specialist what this is all about the specialist replies: “Well, you did ask for a lab test…

Kelly Macdonald talks to Andrew Billen about her journey from the schoolgirl in Trainspotting to her latest roles in the TV drama The Child in Time, and Goodbye Christopher Robin
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
It is, we agree, although we are perhaps a little embarrassed by the truism, every parent’s nightmare: your child by your side one moment, gone the next. Kelly Macdonald, the co-star of Sunday’s BBC adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel The Child in Time, knows how easily it might happen. She watched her own little boy following an older lad in a shop, holding his hand up in the expectation that he would take it, believing the available hand was his mother’s. “And then they sort of parted ways and he saw me — but he hadn’t any idea.”
Sadly, the disappearing child is becoming many viewers’ recurring nightmare too, seen far too frequently in drama: Broadchurch, The Missing, The Killing, The Missing again — and those…

10 UP Selena GomezThe week’s most heart-warming story was without doubt that of the twinkling songstress Selena Gomez, who — in failing health, due to her autoimmune disease, lupus — has had a kidney transplant, with the organ donated by her best friend, Francia Raisa.
“How can I possibly thank my beautiful friend?” Gomez tweeted afterwards. “She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me.”
Bless her, Gomez has made a slight factual error here: the ultimate gift is, in fact, a boxed 1986 Sindy Ballerina, blonde, with moveable joints. CW remembers this being a fact when it was 11, and sees no reason to change its mind now. However, it does raise an interesting point of conversation: which celebrity…

FIRST NIGHT
The latest play in the RSC’s Rome season has our hero suitably blood-soaked, but politically it’s all over the place
September 22 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
★★☆☆☆This is the final chunk of the RSC’s epic Rome season. We’ve had Julius Caesar (meh), Antony and Cleopatra (plodding, but mucho glamour) and Titus Andronicus (blood galore). Now there is Coriolanus, directed by Angus Jackson, who has also been in charge of the whole shebang.
It begins with a forklift truck and three pallets laden with large white sacks. An operator revs up the engine and starts to move the pallets from the front of the iron grille that bisects the stage to the back. Is this Shakespeare, or just another day in the B&Q warehouse? Finally, the task is completed, the grille comes down and some members of the audience begin to clap.
Applaud away, I now think, for that forklift did most…

Richard Morrison: Even the best political art failed to beat the regimes it railed against,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
THE ARTS COLUMN
Richard Morrison
Is it a sign of our dysfunctional times? At present so many artists and performers in Britain and America feel alienated from their governments. Perhaps that explains a surge of interest in music written in totalitarian or repressive regimes.
It’s not so much that arty people are equating today’s political situation with 1930s Germany, or Donald Trump with Mussolini, or Brexit with ethnic cleansing (although you don’t need to plumb the depths of Twitter very far to find supposedly intelligent people doing exactly that). No, it’s more about insecurity. It’s about the arts world questioning whether anything it creates will make any difference to “real events”. It’s about trawling history for reassuring answers.
One potentially fascinating trawl is offered by Suzy Klein, the BBC presenter,…

WNO’s musical director, Tomas Hanus, tells Rebecca Franks he wants to preach mercy through music
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
“Are you going to learn Welsh?” I ask the Czech conductor Tomas Hanus. “If I had time it would be very interesting, but you can’t learn Welsh in 30 minutes,” he says, laughing, “and I can hardly find time to buy a sandwich.”
I can vouch for this. Welsh National Opera’s new music director is preparing for his first autumn of operas with the company and is on a tight schedule. Our interview, in a brightly lit chorus room, takes place over lunch, but he only fits in a bite of the ham and cheese sandwich that someone nipped out to buy him before he has to dash back to rehearsal. Languages are no problem — he can speak or understand six — but Welsh will have…

Matthew Vaughn’s latest action caper is pointless, puerile and abrasively inept filmmaking
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★☆☆☆☆In the spring of 2010 the producer-turned-director Matthew Vaughn, then aged 39, released the movie Kick-Ass and we saw that it was good. It was a bubblegum action movie that pilloried comic-book conventions just as it spoke sweetly about the strains of fatherhood.
Then, in the summer of 2011, Vaughn gave us X-Men: First Class, a reinvigoration of a flagging comic-book franchise through the power of wit, irony and carefully calibrated action sequences. And we saw that this was good too.
In 2014, after some protracted business about whether he was, or was not, directing the sequel to X-Men: First Class (the job went to the original X-Men director Bryan Singer), Vaughn returned with Kingsman: The Secret Service. This was not so good. Yet those…

ALBUM REVIEW
The TV presenter’s Oxbridge tones are great for diction and comprehension, not quite so good at conjuring up the characters, human and animal
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★★☆For such a much-loved children’s classic, Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf has a surprisingly dark history. It was written in 1936, soon after Prokofiev was lured back to Stalin’s Soviet Union with promises of artistic freedom and a lavish lifestyle. Neither materialised. He had to toe the line, just like everyone else.
Peter and the Wolf was itself a political parable: Peter, a Young Pioneer (Stalin’s sinister version of the Boy Scouts), demonstrating to his stubborn grandfather (representing the unreconstructed pre-Bolshevik generation) the right way to run society — even if this society is only a farmyard.
The work was commissioned by Natalya Sats, a children’s theatre director in Moscow. A year after she narrated one of its early performances, she was imprisoned in a…

Recipe: Lindsey Bareham’s sea bass with crushed peas,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
dinner tonight
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
This is a favourite go-to recipe, a dish I make over and over with different fish such as haddock, cod, hake, plaice and sole. It hardly needs a recipe because it’s just fish and peas with a bunch of grilled or roasted cherry tomatoes draped over the fish. The devil, though, is in the detail; presentation is a River Café sort of look. Serve with new potatoes if you are big eaters.
Serves 2Prep 10 minCook 10 min
MethodUse some freshly boiled water to cook the peas and put the rest in a steamer pan. If, incidentally, you don’t have a steamer, you could cook the fish in a hot oven for 10 min, seasoned with a squeeze of lemon and a splash of…

INTERVIEW
The singer, a former world karate champion, used her skills to help her conquer the pop world
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
The singer of the longest-reigning No 1 single in 22 years is reassuring me that if anyone is foolish enough to threaten her with violence, they will come off much worse than she will.
“It’s good to know that if a man tries to punch me in the face, I can sort him out,” says Anne-Marie Nicholson, the voice of Clean Bandit’s record-breaking 2016 smash Rockabye, solo star with hit singles Alarm and Ciao Adios — and a black belt in karate.
“It started when I was nine,” says Nicholson, a very pretty 26-year-old from Thurrock in Essex who, with her shortish blond hair pulled back in a ponytail and baggy sweatshirt riding over three-quarter-length jeans, still looks more like an off-duty pop star than…

Pop review: Fergie: Double Dutchess,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
ALBUM REVIEW
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★☆☆☆The Black Eyed Peas singer’s second solo album displays the lapses of taste our own Fergie has been known to suffer from every now and then, with Fergie (the Californian pop star, not the Duchess of York) losing her dignity in various age-inappropriate ways.
With its bratty hip-hop boasts, playground chants, winsome ballads of puppy love and dated samples, Double Dutchess sounds as though it was made in 1997 by a 21-year-old, not in 2017 by a 42-year-old. And when Fergie does address maturity on the execrable M.I.L.F. $, she could be mistaken for a surgically enhanced porn star trying to break into pop.
Buried amid this are Fergie’s strong vocal powers — displayed to best effect on the emotional, Prince-like Love Is Pain — and sense…

★★★★☆Phoebe Bridgers is a 22-year-old Los Angeles native who, with her clear, light voice, uncluttered indie folk sound and songs about emotionally unstable youth, seems like the latest in a long line of female singer-songwriters being sad and introspective in a photogenic and stylish fashion. A deeper listen to her debut album, however, reveals an original and creative mind with enough self-awareness not to take herself too seriously.
The Twin Peaks-like Smoke Signals has her pondering on the significance of Lemmy and David Bowie’s deaths while accompanying a friend to his Midwestern home town and listening to the Smiths’ How Soon Is Now? in the car; on the upbeat Motion Sickness she is pining for another Californian indie musician, even though he is pretentious…

Pop review: The Killers: Wonderful Wonderful,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
ALBUM REVIEW
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★☆☆In 2004 Brandon Flowers, the singer of the most successful Mormon group since the Osmonds, declared that he wanted the Killers to be “the American U2”. On their first album in five years he has achieved that goal — for good and for bad.
Wonderful Wonderful has a sonic scale and production polish matched only by Bono and his world-saving stadium inhabitants, but it also displays U2’s weakness for allowing grandiosity to smother intimacy of expression, alongside a desire to be all things to all people. Songs move from Arcade Fire-style arena disco (The Man) to heartland rock (Run for Cover) to emotional pop (Some Kind of Love) without too much to bind them beyond the force of Flowers’s voice.
Nonetheless, the Killers are masters…

Jazz review: Gary Peacock Trio: Tangents,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
album review
The American bass player leads his own trio and its sound often seems to span his past identities as an avant-gardist and Zen practitioner
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★☆☆His 31 years with Keith Jarrett’s immensely popular Standards Trio made a minor jazz star of Gary Peacock. When that group dissolved in 2014 it freed the American bass player to lead his own trio. Its sound often seems to span the leader’s past identities as an avant-gardist (with Albert Ayler) and a Zen practitioner. Chords collapse and genres clash, yet serenity reigns. These are plangent tangents.
On Contact each musician assumes a distinct role at odds with the others. Against all odds these random voices coalesce into a rich collective. So the Arabic keening of Peacock’s solo invocation is intruded upon by the frosty piano probings of Marc Copland. Then, when Joey Baron’s Latin-accented drums join in, the bass starts to get funky and…

FILM REVIEW
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★☆☆☆Tennis in movies doesn’t work. We know that. Jonathan Rhys Meyers in Match Point, Paul Bettany in Wimbledon, even poor Farley Granger, woefully whacking out haymaker strokes in Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train. They’re all actors who are farcically ill-equipped to play an actual tennis match.
This is, obviously, not their fault. You can fake motor racing (Days of Thunder), world-class cycling (The Program) or Olympic running (Chariots of Fire), but there’s something about the rhythms and physiological contortions of the professional tennis game that make it virtually impossible to emulate on screen. Even worse, televised tennis has become its own perfect cinematic language, with a roll call of wide shots, close-ups and neatly matched reverse shots that makes any sort of imitation look decidedly…

FILM REVIEW
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★★☆There are echoes of Gossip Girl and Lena Dunham’s Girls in Maysaloun Hamoud’s ferociously smart feature debut. It’s set in and around the lives of young and vibrant Arab-Israeli women (they don’t identify as Palestinian or Israeli — they are, ta-dah, in between), and swaps the Middle Eastern tropes of guns, religious paraphernalia and flying rocks for smartphones, tattoos, booze, marijuana and hip-hop. It’s great fun, with a powerful sense of narrative.
It opens with the vivacious lawyer Layla (Mouna Hawa) and the hipster DJ Salma (Sana Jammelieh) facing the nightmare prospect of a highly conservative and religious new flatmate, Nour (Shaden Kanboura). Initial tensions and potential flashpoints (they casually offer joints to Nour) all dissolve, however, in the face of mutually respectful sisterhood and…

★★★★☆A metaphysical romance featuring a couple of lonely slaughterhouse workers who meet first in their dreams? It sounds like a sophomoric student film, or a rejected Wes Anderson screenplay, but in the hands of the Hungarian director Ildikó Enyedi it becomes something beguiling and troubling.
On Body and Soul dominated this year’s Berlin Film Festival, where it won four prizes (including the Golden Bear for best film), and is, at its heart, a startlingly original romance with bursts of despair. Based mostly in and around a busy abattoir in Budapest, it follows the delicate emerging connection between the new and willowy quality-control officer, Maria (Alexandra Borbely), and the older, wiser financial director, Endre (Géza Morcsányi).
The romance builds in agonising fits and starts: she makes…

★★☆☆☆This feels as if it should be much more profound than it is. It’s a documentary, made by the British film-maker Carol Salter, set in a busy funeral home in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, central China. It tracks the development of the coy and impressionable 17-year-old trainee Ying Ling as she learns to wash corpses, shave them, oil them and speak to them kindly. Death, in other words, is everywhere. As are dead bodies, respectfully filmed, from some distance, by Salter (arms are seen peeking from beneath sheets and we get several shots of uncovered heads — but nothing too Night of the Living Dead).
Since the film matches the giddy youth of Ying Ling with the grim finality of non-existence, you would…

★★★☆☆Flirting with pretension and needless structural chicanery, this vibrant portrait of Cairo on the cusp of the Arab Spring is saved by the director’s obvious affection for the city, and by the eerie sense of visiting a now-vanished place. Shooting mostly in 2009, in the dying days of the Mubarak regime, the Egyptian film-maker Tamer El Said, in making a movie about his love for Cairo, has fashioned a quasi-fictional tale about an Egyptian film-maker (Khalid Abdalla) who is making a movie about his love for Cairo. Yep. It’s one of those.
Street scenes of downtown Cairo dissolve into street scenes on editing software, friends of the film-maker are actually subjects of the film, and a lengthy discussion between fellow directors about the nature of…

FILM REVIEW
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★☆☆A simple narrative trigger leads to labyrinthine deceit and denial in this Lebanese drama that’s part identity thriller, part historical parable. Rabih (Barakat Jabbour) is a blind musician who applies for a passport (a European tour beckons) only to discover that he’s not who he thinks he is, his mother’s a liar, everyone involved in the Lebanese Civil War is guilty of some grand social deception and, worse still, his beloved uncle Hisham (Toufic Barakat) was probably once a village-slaughtering maniac.
There are some thudding, unhelpful metaphors in Tramontane, primarily Rabih himself, who is clearly the embodiment of his country — well-meaning, but blind to the atrocities of its past. Plus Rabih’s discoveries go on for ever (the film’s motto could be: “Truth? What truth?”). But…

FILM REVIEW
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★☆☆☆Octogenarian tango partners María Nieves Rego and Juan Carlos Copes look back on their lives, their 50-year careers and their volatile relationship (married, fought a lot, divorced) in this loving but exhausting documentary from the Argentine film-maker German Kral. The sexy hook here is that Kral doesn’t just interview these two iconic dancers (they were once world-famous, from Tokyo to New York), he recreates their past with young Argentine tango enthusiasts who interview the couple between dances.
Actually, they only interview the effusive, expressive Rego, who has a touch of Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard and is still openly wounded by her relationship with the much trickier, slightly caustic and certainly chauvinistic Copes. “She thought I belonged to her,” he says, mulling over his old…

Dunkirk (1958),"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
CLASSIC FILM OF THE WEEK
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★★☆Finally, a chance to answer the year’s most burning question: is Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk as good as the 1958 version? Fans of context, character and historical detail must surely only answer: “No.” Leslie Norman’s movie positively delights in context, in bouncing between locations (from the French embassy in London to the British Expeditionary Force HQ on the Belgian border), and in bombarding the viewer with relevant dialogue about Chamberlain’s mistakes, the “Phoney War”, and pre-evacuation military tactics such as: “We’re wide open on the right flank. We need the 5th and the 50th in order to stop the Germans having a clear run to the north.”
The plot too is a dense multi-strand affair that follows John Mills as a chipper cockney corporal turned save-the-day…

ALBUM REVIEW
The Horrors have reinvented themselves yet again with an enjoyable fifth album
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★★☆When they first emerged in 2007 amid a cloud of hairspray and attitude, you would not have guessed the Horrors were built to last. Five friends from Southend in Essex with a strong look (emaciated Edwardian undertakers), a great record collection and not much in the way of tunes, they were a stylish garage band best confined to the garage. Yet here they are, a decade later, with a complex, transporting work that shows how tenacity can reap dividends, even from the most parched roots.
This fifth album continues with the Horrors’ general career plan of trying something different each time and crossing their fingers. Their first album was a messy blend of Sixties garage and Eighties post-punk. Their second was a psychedelic odyssey. Their…

Laurence Fox starts out faltering but pulls it off in this revival
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★☆☆We know from Laurence Fox’s turns on television — not least his decade as the sidekick’s sidekick on Lewis — that he really has something as an actor. Something distinctive. An angle. A presence.
What we haven’t quite seen yet is whether he is the real thing on the big stages. In the West End, a dodgy American accent scuppered him in Strangers on a Train. Here, in Tom Stoppard’s masterpiece of a relationship comedy from 1982, he ends up with a winning performance, but only after we’ve sat through an OK performance first. He never looks entirely comfortable until his character becomes less than entirely comfortable.
Fox is Henry, an endlessly urbane playwright who, it takes the full two hours of these exquisitely counterbalanced…

The musicians displayed exemplary speed control on Maxwell Davies’s String Quintet of 2014, which justifiably crowned the night
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★★☆In the new Wigmore Hall season, the Nash Ensemble will be largely spending their time spraying audiences with French perfume: Ravel, Debussy, Poulenc and their ilk. However, we had none of that on Wednesday. The smells and sounds were predominantly new and British. We had Orkney reels and luminous skies from Maxwell Davies, Yorkshire mists from John Casken, and the spiky crags of Birtwistle-land. All these proved well worth savouring, especially with the Nash musicians, succulently vigorous and precise, as guides.
Maxwell Davies’s String Quintet of 2014 justifiably crowned the night, for it is one of the composer’s most masterly late creations: strongly argued, expansive, moving; swirling one minute, shadowed with dark harmonies the next. The musicians displayed exemplary speed control in the finale’s lurches…

FIRST NIGHT
Without accompanying visuals, this celebration of the music in Jim Jarmusch’s films wasn’t much more than a random bunch of songs
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★☆☆☆There was a fundamental design flaw in this celebration of the music in Jim Jarmusch’s films: no films. There was black-and-white footage of buildings at the beginning, but nothing from Down by Law, Mystery Train or any of the American director’s other stylish, unhurried classics.
Music is a huge component of Jarmusch’s movies. To remove the films from the music and not contextualise it in any other way was to leave the concert without narrative thrust, resulting in a random bunch of songs that, unless you were a Jarmusch nut, did not have any real cohesion.
It did, however, give an excuse to stage some great performances. Mulatu Astatke is a 73-year-old Ethiopian vibraphone and conga player whose “Ethio jazz” classic Yekermo Sew was used…

In one of four concerts highlighting living composers it was striking how well Helen Grime’s pieces measured up against those of her seniors
September 22 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★★☆The tentacles of the musical octopus celebrating Simon Rattle’s arrival at the London Symphony Orchestra spread far and wide. He has anointed four living composers who have each been given a concert of their own to curate. Helen Grime, the youngest, dutifully completed the magic circle by including two of Rattle’s other chosen composers in her programme, as well as Stravinsky — another figure championed by the maestro in his opening festival. It’s all a bit clannish, but happily it sparked terrific music-making from the Britten Sinfonia led (usually from the violin) by that force of nature, Jacqueline Shave.
For me the chief excitement was not the pulsating performances of Thomas Adès’s Court Studies, Britten’s Sinfonietta and Stravinsky’s Dumbarton Oaks that finished the concert. Nor…

★★★☆☆She is on stage when we arrive, sitting in an armchair. Emily Stilson was an aviatrix and wing walker but now she is in her seventies, an old woman enjoying her own company. But what’s this? Lights flash. Blackout! Now it gets very noisy. Suddenly Emily is airborne, circling, tumbling above us, lit up in the dark centre swathe of this traverse staging. She is saying words, words, words, but it is all, to use the technical term, gobbledegook.
Juliet Stevenson is Emily, the star of this austere play by the American Arthur Kopit, who wrote it for radio in 1976, months after his father had suffered a debilitating stroke. He based the character on two women he had met at his father’s rehab centre.…

The Supervet Channel 4★★★☆☆
Tribes, Predators & Me BBC Two★★★★☆
I’m still not clear, ten series in, who in the literal sense “enjoys” The Supervet. If you dislike animals it will bore you as much as Formula One bores me (unless you get a sadistic thrill from a saw carving up a schnauzer’s leg, in which case you’re going to Hell, my friend). If you love animals then watching it is pure trauma. The sound of Lulu the staffie crying in pain after being hit by a car made me utterly miserable, even though it was only brief (yes, I know worse things happen in the world, but what can I tell you? Suffering dogs: can’t be doing with it).
Noel Fitzpatrick, Supervet himself, is…

Viewing guide, by James Jackson
Rock and RollSky Arts, 9pmNever underestimate the importance of the lyrics to a great pop song. Whether they’re painting an image, conjuring up a feeling or using poetry to provoke ideas, they can turn a simple three-minute pop song into something approaching high art. So little surprise that Bob Dylan features at the top of this week’s episode, titled Poetry. David Gray suggests that Dylan, in his lyrics, “changed people’s ideas about what rock’n’roll was and just how sophisticated it could be as a cultural force’’. However, one of the virtues of this top-class series, analysing each week a different theme of rock’n’roll, is how it sprawls into less obvious areas while disregarding the hackneyed chronological approach. Soon,…

This gel is my favourite in the range; a rather eye-watering £50 for 60ml, but totally worth it.
