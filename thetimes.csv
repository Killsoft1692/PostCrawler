Any information about yourself or others that you submit on social media sites, including chat rooms, blogs and forums, will be viewed by other people. As such, this personal data may be viewed, collected and used by third parties, including search engines, over which we have no control.

We may pass your information to suppliers we use to provide services that involve using data on our behalf, for example for delivery services or market research agencies.

We will only disclose your information to third party companies for their purposes, including marketing, when we have your permission to do so. For example, if we run a competition, the partner providing the prize may want to send entrants information about their products.
We may offer co-branded services or features, such as competitions or other promotions, together with a third party and may share the information you provide with that third party.  These co-branded services may be hosted by us or by the third party. The third party’s use of your information will be governed by their privacy policy, which you should always read.
Our services may be linked to websites operated by third party companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests, sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.

Your personal information will be disclosed where we are obliged by law to do so.  We may also disclose your personal information where we are allowed by law to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of others and for the detection and prevention of crimes, such as fraud. 
If you post or send offensive or objectionable content anywhere on or to any of our websites or apps, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our websites or apps, we may use the information that is available to us about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

Customer information will be used to take payment for products and services and may be used to verify credit details related to this payment. Permission to do so is implicit in providing financial details to process payment. Direct debit information may be retained for ease of renewal of services.
If you apply for credit, then, in order to help us to make credit decisions about you, prevent fraud, check your identity and prevent money laundering, we may search the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your file. We may also disclose details of how you conduct your account to such agencies. The information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors.

Where this is the case, you will be able to unsubscribe from these communications in the same way. 
You may request a copy of your personal information from any News UK company which may hold about you (for which we may charge a small processing fee).  You can also ask us to correct any inaccuracies in your personal information (which is free).
We will retain your information for as long as necessary for the uses set out in this Policy.  If you ask us to delete your information before that time, we may not be able to do so, due to technical, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints.  For example, we would need to retain your name and contact details for suppression purposes if you do not want to receive direct marketing from us. 
If you ask for your account to be closed, we will do this as soon as is reasonably possible subject to any applicable terms and conditions relating to the account. Personal information from closed accounts is retained in order to comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed or to resolve disputes.

Cookies are placed on your browser which will remember the websites you have visited.  Advertising based on what you have been looking at is then displayed to you when you visit websites who use the same advertising networks. 
For example:  You may be doing online research in order to buy a bicycle, and read a number of articles about bikes on various websites. As you browse those sites a cookie from an advertising network would be placed in your browser. It would remember that you had visited several websites related to cycling. Then, when you visited another website in the same advertising network, the website could show you an advert related to cycling.

Hummingbird hawkmoths are now being spotted in small numbers all across the country. They hover in front of flowers, their wings moving so fast that they produce a humming sound and are seen as little more than a blur. In the case of the hindwings, this is an orange blur. Otherwise they just look brown. They dart from flower to flower, using their long proboscis to draw the nectar from them. Favoured flowers are honeysuckle, buddleia and petunias. They will also hover in front of a sunlit wall to absorb the warmth. These moths are regularly misidentified as birds, not insects, but no hummingbirds are seen in Britain. Hummingbird hawkmoths are summer migrants that come up from the south of France, but some of them breed here, laying their eggs on the yellow lady’s bedstraw. However, almost none of them survive the winter, including the new ones that have hatched here.

Rates of suicide and sexual attacks by male troops are shockingly high in the US military
Last Friday at 5pm the Veterans Affairs Department in Washington released its analysis of suicide statistics for the 55 million people who left the US armed services between 1970 and 2014. It’s a quiet time of the news week, designed to attract little interest. And that’s not surprising because the figures were shocking. They showed that male veterans had a 20 per cent increased risk of suicide over male non-vets. Female veterans, though, were 250 per cent more likely to kill themselves than other women.
Which raises the question: just as women are being encouraged to join in larger numbers, what is happening to them that so markedly increases their suicide risk? Serving in an army at war is stressful but why should women suffer…

The prime minister must give the speech of her life in Florence otherwise Brexit vagueness will wreck the economy
Anyone who has ever worked for a large business or serious organisation will be aware of the need for proper forward planning. Under the cover of all that annoying talk about strategy and “blue-sky thinking”, good companies think ahead and ask practical questions. What are we going to do next year to make more money? What could go wrong? What decisions have to be taken now to avert potential difficulties?
It is in this context, with business and the wider country asking what the precise plan is for Brexit, that the prime minister’s make or break speech in Florence tomorrow should be seen. In the last year business leaders have been messed around enough by the Tories, who all but branded them crooks in their…

End of an era as financial crisis measure is put into reverse
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
The US Federal Reserve is to put its multitrillion-dollar quantitative easing programme into reverse almost nine years after it was implemented to shore up the economy at the height of the financial crisis.
The Fed’s policymaking committee announced last night that the central bank would begin to trim its $4.5 trillion asset portfolio next month, marking the end of an era of unprecedented intervention.
As was expected, the federal funds rate was held at 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent in a unanimous vote.
The Fed began buying toxic mortgage-backed securities and US government bonds in late November 2008, swelling its balance sheet by $3.7 trillion by the time that the stimulus programme had ended in October 2014.
Janet Yellen, the bank’s chairwoman, said…

September 21 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
Theresa May briefed the cabinet this morning on her plans to break a deadlock in the Brexit negotiations in a keynote speech in Florence tomorrow.
The prime minister convened the emergency meeting in a bid to bind Boris Johnson and other senior ministers to her vision of Brexit on the eve of the address.
It comes days after the foreign secretary raised the prospect of resigning if Mrs May made an offer he saw as too great a compromise with the EU. He later climbed down from the threat.
Mr Johnson and Mrs May flew back to the UK after attending the United Nations general assembly in New York and headed straight to Downing St this morning.
Her speech tomorrow will be a crucial attempt…

BREXIT | analysis
Lucy Fisher, Senior Political Correspondent
Theresa May’s aim to set out her Brexit pitch to EU member state leaders tomorrow over the head of their official negotiator is unlikely to elicit their warm response — at least on record.
The prime minister is planning to seek to influence national leaders directly in her speech in Florence and is likely to flesh out some details of a divorce bill offer. She has insisted that any decisions about deals with Britain will be taken by heads of member states in the European Council rather than by Michel Barnier and his negotiating team in the European Commission.
Her bid to address national leaders directly shows scant respect for the formal and strict constraints that they have collectively agreed for the negotiating process.

She blinked. The news filtered through to Brussels from the United Nations, and the Germans, in New York on Tuesday evening that Theresa May was ready to pay up. The prime minister is expected to use her big Florence speech tomorrow to promise the European Union that it will not be left short after Brexit on its spending plans until 2021.
While her language will be carefully scrutinised, the Conservative leader will take the big political step of fleshing out a July commitment that the “government recognises that the UK has obligations to the EU that will survive the UK’s withdrawal”.
It is no surprise. Britain had asked for a delay in Brexit negotiations for “consultations” that the EU side always believed would lead to…

It seems that 4,000 words can do a lot of damage to confidence in a very short space of time. I’m still not sure if our current foreign secretary was thinking “fast or slow” when he wrote his magnum opus last weekend but the impact on business large and small has been nothing other than deeply unsettling.
In August high-stakes politics took a good breather, which was good news for everyone exhausted with it. It seemed to be good news for business too. Silly season emerged on the backbenches with the prospect of “The Mogg” becoming Tory leader but cabinet unity prevailed.
More than that, some of our own analysis here at Cicero Group during August suggested a clear majority in cabinet pushing for a…

A boy of 17 has become the sixth person to be arrested by police investigating the Parsons Green terrorist attack.
He was arrested in Thornton Heath, south London, shortly after midnight and officers from the Metropolitan police’s counterterrorism command are searching the property.
Three men believed to be asylum seekers were arrested this week in Newport, Wales.
A 25-year-old student from Kurdistan Iran, known as “Bilal”, was detained at his home in Newport on Tuesday night. Two other suspects, aged 48 and 30, were arrested yesterday in a dawn raid on a second property about a mile away which is used to house asylumseekers. Neighbours said that five men of Middle Eastern origin lived there.
The Met were already questioning an unnamed 18-year-old refugee from…

Bare mattresses had been lined wall-to-wall in each of its three bedrooms and in every other rooms, including the kitchen, except the bathrooms. There was even a gazebo on the rear patio with a mattress inside for sleeping.
The semi-detached house in a residential street in Brent, northwest London, looked very ordinary from the outside, with bay windows and a small porch at the front. It had been extended with a loft conversion, adding two additional second-storey bedrooms.
Council officers accompanied by police raided the property just before 6am yesterday after neighbours reported acts of antisocial behaviour, fly-tipping in the garden and…

Ibrahim Metwaly, 53, was en route to Geneva to address a UN working group about Mr Regeni’s brutal killing and state kidnappings in Egypt when he vanished ten days ago.
He was later found in detention in Cairo, where he was being held on charges of “communicating with foreign entities to harm state security” and forming a group “against the law and the constitution”.

Drug dealers scouting for new clients among freshers at the University of Manchester have been handing out business cards near halls of residence.
Cards marked with telephone numbers, names and business hours have been left in the Fallowfield area of the city where new undergraduates are moving in.
Students have reportedly been approached along a 50-metre stretch opposite the main entrance to Owens Park, which houses 1,000 students, according to a report in the Manchester Evening News. Some have reportedly been given free lighters.
One resident claimed that dealers had given out free samples of cannabis with their cards.

During a speech to African leaders in New York Mr Trump lauded Nambia’s health system as “increasingly self-sufficient” before going on to refer to the nation a second time.
The president made the gaffe as part of a welcome to dignitaries including President Buhari of Nigeria and President Zuma of South Africa on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly in New York.
Did he mean Zambia? Seemingly not, as the White House official transcript later corrected his pronunciation to make clear that he had intended to say Namibia, on the continent’s southwestern flank.

Smokers’ chances of quitting successfully are higher than at any time on record, as widespread use of e-cigarettes helps people give up, a study concludes.
One in five attempts to stop smoking now results in people quitting long term, a third higher than normal, a study found.
Public Health England will endorse e-cigarettes in TV ads for the first time as part of efforts to encourage people to give up in its Stoptober campaign next month.
However, despite growing acceptance of vaping among experts, the continued division over their use is illustrated by separate draft NHS guidance that GPs should not recommend e-cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid. Instead they should only offer advice on using them.

Seven million patients are treated at GP surgeries with serious safety problems, according to the first comprehensive review.
Inspectors urged patients to switch to better performing surgeries after finding that one in seven had issues with safety and one in ten was not good enough overall.
They uncovered “pockets of persistent poor care” including out-of-date medicines, a failure to follow up on test results, delayed cancer diagnoses and a lack of checks on the medical qualifications of staff.
Smaller surgeries were more likely to do badly, the review showed, with the worst half the size of the best. They have been ordered to end “professional isolation” by linking with neighbouring surgeries to share resources and expertise.

Susan Wynne-Willson, 69, was accused of slapping, biting and terrorising a son and daughter during 14 years of torment after the family swapped a Yorkshire mansion for a London squat.
The mother of five was found not guilty by the jury, which had been repeatedly told about concerns surrounding the use of regression therapy to help her daughter “remember” childhood abuse.
Ms Wynne-Willson held her head in her hands when the verdicts were read out before looking over at her children in the public gallery at Blackfriars crown court. Her daughter, Rosa, screamed and then ran from…

When Susan Wynne-Willson appeared naked on the front of an underground magazine it heralded a new era of liberalism at the height of the swinging Sixties.
Her portrayal in court as head of a dysfunctional family during her trial for cruelty to two of her children was in stark contrast to the idealistic teenager photographed in 1967 wearing only body paint for the cover of the International Times.
Then named Susie Gawler-Wright, known as the “psychedelic debutante”, she was at the heart of the drug-fuelled counterculture movement and a friend of Syd Barrett, the lead singer of Pink Floyd.

The director described political correctness as “the death of comedy” and said that studio executives would have rejected his 1974 satirical take on westerns.
“It’s OK not to hurt the feelings of various tribes and groups,” he told the BBC. “However it’s not good for comedy. Comedy has to walk a thin line, take risks. It’s the lecherous little elf whispering in the king’s ear, telling the truth about human behaviour.”

A surge in knife possession is not just down to the region’s longstanding gang problems or young men in urban areas, according to the West Midlands’ elected police chief. “It’s all groups, it’s all ethnicities and interestingly as well it’s all generations,” David Jamieson, police and crime commissioner, said. “There are older generations where there’s knife crime and violence is taking place, which makes it much more complicated problem to tackle.”

The popularity of degree apprenticeships is rocketing, with growing numbers of employers signing up bright school-leavers, according to the Institute of Student Employers.
Degree apprenticeships grew by 50 per cent this year, it says in a report released today. Although in their infancy, they are expected to grow dramatically in the next few years, with high-achieving teenagers seeing them as a credible alternative to university.
School-leavers who join companies as degree apprentices start work immediately and receive a salary. They do not pay tuition fees, and emerge with a degree-level qualification often obtained through a university.

“The point is that terrorism is crime and all terrorists are criminals. As such, they should be arrested, charged and brought before the courts, and the more that can be done under general criminal legislation the better,” he said.
He cited “two major terrorist atrocities” that did not need terrorism legislation: the murders of Fusilier Lee Rigby and the Labour MP Jo Cox.

Theresa May threatened last night to withhold tens of millions of pounds in British contributions to the United Nations as she warned of a “crisis of faith” in global bodies.
The prime minister demanded urgent reforms to the UN, characterising it as bloated, disorganised and hit by abuse scandals in a speech to world leaders at the organisation’s general assembly in New York.
She presented Britain as an outward-facing country working to uphold the global order but echoed some of President Trump’s message earlier in the week that financial contributions to the UN were now under threat.
In the 15-minute address, Mrs May attacked Russia’s behaviour on the UN security council and criticised Mr Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal. She…

The word Brexit was missing from Theresa May’s UN speech, and not by chance. The prime minister believes there is more to Britain than its decision to leave the European Union, and wanted to portray it as an outward-facing, active participant in global affairs.
She wanted to assert Britain’s role in the world — from North Korea to Syria and Russia — showing it had not turned inward as critics claim. However, her central message was more nuanced: while declaring Britain supportive of global institutions and international rules, the headlines from her speech concentrated on the negative aspects of the UN and its agencies and its need to change or die.
Although Downing Street denied any link to threats by Donald Trump to slash contributions…

Only half of the total expenses bill was claimed by the most active 300 peers, “showing the size of the Lords can be cut without significantly limiting its work”, the society, which lobbies…

It was a trademark May performance, full of zinging phrases like “a more agile, transparent and joined-up organisation” or “this rules-based system we have developed”. It is, of course, a far safer style of oratory than President Trump and his “let’s nuke the bastards” bombast.

It has turned farmer against farmer, scientist against scientist and animal lover against animal lover. Perhaps it was inevitable that culling badgers to save cows would pit brother against brother too.
The siblings at the centre of the Riverford organic food empire, famed for supplying weekly fruit and vegetable boxes to 50,000 middle-class homes, have taken opposite views on whether badgers should be shot on their land.
Up to 33,000 are due to be killed in coming weeks under a scheme to stem the spread of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. The government increased the number of culls from ten to 21 this year after 40,000 cows were slaughtered prematurely over the past 12 months because they tested positive for the disease. The new cull areas…

A British former head teacher who was shot and robbed by a drug gang while she was kayaking solo on the Amazon may still have been alive when they threw her into the river, police said yesterday.
Emma Kelty, 43, had pitched her tent on the banks of the Solimões River, the upper reaches of the Amazon, last week when the gang, who refer to themselves as pirates, attacked. She was three months into her effort to paddle 4,000 miles from the river’s source to the sea. Ivo Martins, deputy chief of police in the region, said: “Emma was hit by two gunshots from a .20 calibre sawn-off shotgun. We believe the injured woman was still alive when her attackers threw her body into the…

The origins of freshers’ week are lost in the mists of time, and even recent graduates struggle to piece together memories of theirs through an alcoholic haze.
Enough is enough, says one vice-chancellor who is advising students to turn their backs on drink and drug-fuelled debauchery at the start of term. Instead they should embrace allotments, tranquil spaces and welfare dogs for the good of their mental health.
Too many universities are ignoring excessive drinking and drug-taking among freshers, leaving them at risk of mental health problems, according to a report by Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor at Buckingham University. In its acknowledgements the report pays tribute to Millie and Darcy, the university dogs, for their calming influence.
Sir Anthony runs Britain’s first “positive” university, and…

Britain’s acting dames are in a silent battle to be the country’s most-prolific film actress, although neither is likely to have realised it is going on.
Dame Judi Dench edged ahead of Dame Maggie Smith last week with the release of Victoria & Abdul, taking her tally of British films to 41, according to figures released by the British Film Institute.
Both actresses are 82 but Dame Maggie, who is on 40 films, had been in the lead for most of her career thanks to an earlier start. While she made her feature film debut in 1959 in Nowhere to Go, Dame Judi was advised by her agent at the time to stick to theatre.

Unlike Grant, my libidinous hobbit, I am very innocent so there could have been all sorts of filthy behaviour going on at the Liberal Democrat conference and I’d have missed it. It’s unlikely, though. In his new Coalition Diaries, David Laws, the former Lib Dem minister, recalls a conversation with Ken Clarke about debauchery. “The Liberals have much lower-quality sex scandals,” observed Clarke, the former Tory chancellor. “In the Conservative Party you get the full works — Chelsea football kits, toe-sucking, exotic sexual equipment and the deployment of a wide variety of fruit and vegetables. What do you get from the Liberals? Just a bit of bum pinching!” How easily (to his relief) Mark Oaten was forgotten but perhaps it gives Sir Vince Cable something to…

Scientists in Britain have snipped a “master gene” out of human embryos in an experiment that could lead to better fertility treatments and galvanise stem cell medicine.
It is the first time that researchers have carried out this pioneering procedure to reach a deeper understanding of the earliest stages of human life. The work raises the prospect of significant improvements in IVF success rates.
In the long run, however, its greatest benefit is likely to be a way of sending adult cells back to an early stage of development that allows them to repair damage to any part of the body.
This would help biologists to discover new drugs and to combat a wide range of illnesses with a kind of super stem cell derived…

Go to any public place in a few years’ time and shout “Ollie?” or “Olivia?” and you can expect an awful lot of children to turn to answer.
These remained the most popular first names last year in the annual list compiled by the Office for National Statistics. Oliver has been the most popular name in England and Wales since 2013; Olivia was the most popular from 2008 to 2010 and regained the crown last year. From 2011 to 2015 the most common girl’s name was Amelia.

If hands-free mobile headsets still leave you wondering why people are talking to themselves in the street, things are about to get a lot worse.
“Smart glasses” resembling ordinary spectacles will soon allow people to talk to Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant, any time they please.
Sources familiar with the plans said that the glasses would be connected to the user’s mobile phone by Bluetooth, and a bone-conduction audio system in the arms of the spectacles would allow the wearer to hear Alexa without having to wear earphones. The glasses could be launched as early as this year.
People wearing the glasses could ask for directions, news or sports results, order an Uber taxi or play music, with commands picked up by a built-in microphone.

The suffragist Millicent Fawcett has overcome what may be her last hurdle, 88 years after her death. Planning permission has been granted for her to become the first woman to have a statue in Parliament Square.
An 8.5ft bronze casting of the feminist campaigner is to stand beside statues of Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. The decision comes after a year-long campaign that set her advocates against those who favoured a monument to Emmeline Pankhurst, the suffragette who rejected Fawcett’s mode of peaceful protest.
Gillian Wearing, the Turner prize-winning artist, unveiled her design yesterday, revealing a detailed model of Fawcett holding a sign that reads: “Courage calls to courage everywhere”. The quote comes from a speech she gave upon the death of the suffragette…

A vast space that forms part of the new Gucci HQ on the outskirts of the city was decorated with mock statues in the styles of ancient Greece and Rome, spliced with hints of Egypt and a soupçon of Aztec. The spring/summer 2018 collection was at least as diverse, with Michele’s signature mix and mash-up of home counties chic, sports luxe, chinoiserie, 1970s disco, 1980s power dressing and — deep breath — the Renaissance. As always, all of the above had been embellished…

Ryanair has been accused of breaking the law by hiding details about compensation from hundreds of thousands of passengers caught up in the airline’s flight-cancellation chaos.
The carrier is sending cancellation emails to passengers that make no explicit mention of their legal right to a payout of at least £221. Under EU legislation, passengers can claim compensation on top of a refund or alternative flight if aircraft have been grounded with less than two weeks’ notice, with higher payouts of £354 available for longer flights.
However, the standard email sent to customers on the 2,100 cancelled flights simply contains a link to “information on passenger rights under EU regulation EU261/2004” with no explanation of their entitlement.

The public inquiry into child abuse was accused yesterday of failing to investigate crucial questions and call important witnesses in the case of the late MP Cyril Smith.
Lawyers for alleged victims of Smith said that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) appeared to have “little curiosity” about issues in the case, including a claim that the politician was given a guarantee of immunity from prosecution when he was selected as the Liberal candidate for Rochdale in 1970.
Laura Hoyano, counsel for some of Smith’s alleged victims, criticised the inquiry for failing to pursue evidence identified by Neil Garnham, QC, when he was asked in 2014 to investigate allegations of abuse in Rochdale.

Major-General Julian Thompson, in a letter to The Times, also condemns the decision to abandon training in the United States and Norway this year to save money. “This sends a ‘we are not interested’ message to the likes of [President] Putin and others who might wish to do us harm,” he writes.
The retired officer said it reminded him of “a similar ‘message’ transmitted by a Tory government in 1982” in the run-up to Argentina’s invasion of the Falklands. Deep cuts had been inflicted on the Royal Navy the previous year.

The study is the first to hint at the scale of demand in Britain and will add urgency to the debate around criminal sanctions for abortion. Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: “The numbers of women in Britain seeking abortion pills online documented in this study are quite staggering, particularly given that it covers just one service over a four-month period.”

Gender stereotyping is closing off opportunities for girls in all aspects of their lives by lowering or limiting their aspirations, according to Girlguiding.
Assumptions about how girls are expected to think and act undermine their confidence and limit their choices, from the way they dress to the subjects they study and sports they play at school, it said.
An annual survey of girls and young women commissioned by the charity found they routinely encountered gender stereotypes on social media, on television and in films, and also from parents, teachers and other girls.
More than half of respondents, aged from seven to 21, said that such stereotyping affected their ability to say what they thought, the clothes they wore and how they acted around other girls,…

Psychologists argue that we could organise our evenings with the same discipline and rigour we bring to our working days instead of slacking off with a box set and a large glass of rioja.
David Randles and his colleagues at Toronto University have challenged the popular notion that willpower is a limited resource and dwindles over the course of the day.

Robot sex dolls that can be programmed to resist advances, enabling men to enjoy “raping” them, should be outlawed, a barrister and campaigner has said.

The Roxxxy model launched by True Companion, a US-based artificial intelligence company, enables customers to simulate rape. Ms Parker said that while it was not an offence to own one of the dolls it normalises sexual violence.

More than 9 million motorists are continuing to use mobile phones behind the wheel despite a government crackdown on the offence, a survey suggests.
It found that a “hard core” of dangerous drivers were still making calls, texting, using social media and even taking videos. The research by the RAC concluded that a dip in the number of traffic police over recent years had sent out the message that persistent offenders can “get away with it by continuing to flout the law every day”.
Since March, offenders have received six points on their licence and a £200 fine — up from three points and a £100 penalty. New drivers can have their licence revoked for a first offence within two years of passing their test.

A conservation charity has condemned the growing practice of releasing butterflies at weddings, warning that it risks spreading disease and genetic weaknesses among the insects.
Butterfly Conservation is particularly concerned by the use of monarch butterflies as “live confetti”. It says this is illegal because they are not native to Britain. The creatures are unable to breed because milkweed, on which their caterpillars feed, does not grow here.
Several monarchs, native to North America, were seen recently near Canford Cliffs in Poole, Dorset. The charity believes that they were released at a wedding near by.
Several companies in Britain have begun offering butterfly releases, charging about £120 for a box of ten sent in the post.

To test her ability to drive safely she was invited on the ITV show 100 Year Old Driving School. Before the test, overseen by an official of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, she said: “I love driving and just being free, being on four wheels and going where I want to go.”

Ghost town has third of shops empty,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Burslem, in Stoke-on-Trent, has earned the dubious accolade of top ghost town in the UK, with almost one in three shops on its high street lying empty.
A study by the Local Data Company found that the shop vacancy rate of 31.5 per cent in the first half of this year was nearly three times above the national average of 12.2 per cent. Pictures of the once-thriving Potteries town show a desolate high street with dozens of vacant shops boarded up. Locals blame the demise of the pottery industry and, more recently, the spectre of Brexit. They have called for more to be done to encourage independent shops and big chains to open in the area. Amit Patel, 42, owner of the Booze and News…

Stalin film lands satirist in the thick of it,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
It has been hailed as a darkly comic satire on the absurdities of Soviet bureaucracy. However, not everyone is excited by The Death of Stalin.
Armando Iannucci’s film has riled the hard left, with the Communist Party in Russia demanding that it is banned from cinemas and British communists raging against “one-sided western propaganda”.
The film shows sycophantic members of Stalin’s inner circle competing to save themselves after his death in 1953. The British-led cast includes Simon Russell Beale as the secret police chief Lavrentiy Beria, Michael Palin as the foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov and Andrea Riseborough as Stalin’s daughter Svetlana.
Iannucci, who has satirised Westminster and Washington in The Thick of It and Veep, has described his new film as “a form of nervous…

A supermarket in London has become the first in the world to allow customers to pay for groceries using the veins in their fingertips.
The “Fingopay” technology, installed at Costcutter at Brunel University, uses biometric readers which deploy infrared light to map customers’ veins in 3D, generating a unique personal identifier.
Customers who register to associate their vein signature with their bank card can use their finger to make payments in three seconds. The technology is already used in cashpoints in Poland, Japan and Turkey but this is the first time that it has been installed in a store for permanent use.
Biometrics are being used increasingly often for payments and security. People can use the fingerprint scanners on their phones but these can be…

A care home resident who died after eating bleach tablets that looked like mints waited three hours for an ambulance, an inquest was told.
Joe Serginson, 85, suffered from diabetes and had dementia. He took a tub from a cleaner’s trolley and swallowed the soluble tablets.
A senior carer told the inquest that she forced her fingers into his mouth to try to retrieve the tablets before phoning for an ambulance.
The incident happened at about 2pm on August 1 last year. Several ambulance crews were told to attend Balmoral Court in Byker, Newcastle, but were diverted to other cases.
At 5.12pm, after the fifth call to the North East Ambulance Service, a crew arrived and took Mr Serginson to the Royal Victoria Infirmary. Doctors…

A decorated bomb disposal expert and two serving soldiers face a fourth inquiry into the death of a young Iraqi 13 years ago, despite being cleared of any wrongdoing several times.
An investigation into the drowning of Saeed Shabram, 18, allegedly forced at gunpoint into a river in Basra, has been reordered by the Ministry of Defence.
The three Royal Engineers were told last week they would not face criminal charges over the incident, it emerged last night.
However, the soldiers, including a retired major, face a further judge-led inquiry by the Iraqi Fatality Investigations (IFI) unit. Last year they were told that they could be the first soldiers to be prosecuted as a result of criminal inquiries by the now discredited and disbanded Iraq…

Care home inspectors received four complaints a day about ill-treatment of residents or unsafe environments last year.
The Care Quality Commission took action over 1,512 cases in 2016-17, a rise of 68 per cent on the year before.
Incidents involved too few staff, “abuse and improper treatment” and a lack of food and water.
A report by the watchdog revealed that four care homes were taken to court, including one in which a 62-year-old man had broken his neck after falling from a shower chair.
Fifty homes were fined and 100 operators were struck off the register, so had to close down. Scores of others were warned that they would face closure if services did not improve.
Reporting on 5,300 sites, the commission found that…

A judge in a specialist court has made a landmark decision that will affect the relatives of terminally-ill people, lawyers say.
Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that a 50-year-old woman who had suffered from Huntington’s disease for 20 years should be allowed to die after a hearing in the Court of Protection, where judges analyse issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves, in London.
The woman’s daughter and her doctors all agreed that life support treatment should end.
Mr Justice Jackson said that judges should not be required to make rulings in similar cases, where relatives and doctors were in agreement and medical guidelines had been followed.
Mr Justice Jackson said he could understand why the woman’s mother…

Church officials have addressed “concerns” by worshippers after allowing a cathedral to be used to make Hellboy, a film about a giant red demon summoned by the Nazis.
Filming has been taking place at Wells Cathedral in Somerset, with previous reports suggesting that it was for Dr Who or Fantastic Beasts 2. It has now emerged that a production company was making sections for the latest in the Hellboy franchise, which has been called Rise of the Blood Queen.
The main character is summoned from hell by the Nazis to help win the Second World War for Germany, but then adopted by the Allies.
A Wells Cathedral spokeswoman said that the dean and chapter had agreed to let the production company use the cathedral to…

Voters see the role of foreign secretary as less important than health and defence
What do the public think are the real great offices of state? The four great offices are traditionally the prime minister, chancellor, foreign and home secretaries. But what do the public think are the most important cabinet positions?
YouGov research reveals which cabinet positions the British public consider to be the most important and the results are bad news for Amber Rudd and, particularly, Boris Johnson.
If the traditional great offices were to be filled by what the public think are the most important, the prime minister would be followed by the chancellor of the exchequer, the health secretary and the defence secretary.
The survey shows which cabinet roles are broadly seen as among the more or less important posts. Of the 19 cabinet positions…

Most of our part-time peers earn more than average full-time workers
Former Lords speaker Baroness D’Souza made a startling admission last February in the BBC’s Meet the Lords series. She said: “There are many, many, many [Peers] who contribute absolutely nothing but who claim the full allowance.”
She spent months investigating peers who claim without contributing — but the inquiry was dropped amid fears of a backlash.
Today though, the full picture is revealed. Extensive analysis of voting, speaking and expenses records in the Lords shows a “something for nothing” culture among some peers — and a need for substantive reform.
We’re witnessing an “expenses free-for-all” in the Mother of All Parliaments, with expenses claims soaring in just two years — at a time when public services have been under strain.

Inequalities in society ‘are the greatest challenge of our time’
We often hear that Brexit is the main dividing line in our country. It can seem that way in Westminster. Last week’s vote showed how divided Parliament is on the vital issue of how (not whether) Brexit should proceed. The irony that a campaign to restore parliamentary sovereignty has ended in legislation allowing this Government to ignore Parliament, was not lost on the 290 MPs who voted against the Government’s power-grab Bill. But beyond House of Commons, divisions in Britain run much deeper.
In recent years a gulf has emerged between those who earn extraordinary sums and those that scrape by; those who can find a job in their area and those who can’t; those that our slashed social security system still supports to get…

Stark choice for Burma’s Rohingyas — bloody violence or despair in mud

As part of a week of social action with the Conservative Friends of Bangladesh, I have spent time with MPs and volunteers in and around the camps in Cox’s Bazar speaking to people who have been displaced from their burnt-out villages, aid workers and Bangladeshi government ministers.
One was a 60-year-old lady in Kutupalong refugee camp, holding her grandchild. Her son-in-law had been stabbed in front of them. Village children were beheaded. Other young boys had their genitals mutilated, suggesting that this was to stop the Rohingya population reproducing. In one of many…

A plane isn’t usually the easiest place to grab a decent sleep. However, one airline is promising to make naps a lot more comfortable by installing double beds.
Qatar Airways has become the first airline in the world to install doubles in business class. The beds will be created through the removal of privacy panels between adjoining seats — creating a double for two passengers travelling side by side.
They will be available on the airline’s daily Boeing 777 service between Heathrow and Doha. The service forms part of the Gulf airline’s new Qsuite cabins, which it describes as “first-class produce in business class”.
Up to four passengers travelling together are also able to transform their seats to form a private area so that families,…

Vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) has fallen for the third year in a row, prompting concern among experts about the return of deadly diseases.
In 2016-17, 91.6 per cent of children had the triple jab by their second birthday, down from 92.7 per cent in 2013-14, NHS figures show.
This means that about 56,000 two-year-olds in the UK are not protected by the MMR vaccine, 2,000 more than the year before.
Public Health England promised to do more to get children immunised but has played down fears of a revival of anti-vaccine sentiment. Vaccination rates collapsed after now discredited claims by the disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield that the MMR jab causes autism.
London has the worst vaccination rate in England at 85.1…

There is a petulant quality to some of the criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi. “After all we’ve done for her”, it seems to run, “stuck her picture up on the wall at the BBC, voted for her in online polls for ‘most inspiring person of 2015’, and even gave her the Nobel Prize, and this is how she repays us.” Beacons of hope with feet of clay and all that. Big disappointment all round.
As a response to the movement of a people from their homes by violence (I loathe the term “ethnic cleansing”) this certainly beats the assertion I’ve seen in several places that since the Burmese Rohingya minority are Muslims it must be their fault. And it’s understandable. The victory of Ms…

It is a bizarre experience as a journalist to witness an event which then spins off into a myriad of conspiracy theories. I wrote on Saturday how a feminist campaigner was punched at Speakers’ Corner by a trans rights activist. A video online confirms what I saw with my own eyes.
To recap: a woman taking photos had her camera snatched and, while wrestling with the snatcher, was smacked in the head by a tall, male-bodied person in make-up. (I can’t confirm if the assailant was male or a trans woman as s/he legged it before we could discuss pronouns.)
This was a simple, prosaic, spontaneous fracas. But since it is dire publicity for trans activists, affirming the long-held feminist view that their cause is…

Despite this, American companies have yet to develop countermeasures which effectively deter terrorists from exploiting their technologies.
Isis propaganda, broadcast globally using tools like YouTube and Google Drive, has helped engineer perceptions that enable the group to persuade supporters to execute attacks in the West. Concurrently, social media sites like Twitter have been used by Isis to identify prospective recruits. Once recruited, these individuals may be remotely groomed to execute attacks.

Theresa May had a chance last night to rehearse the international role this country could play after Brexit, and she made the most of it
For a prime minister derided at home as weak and ineffective, Theresa May did an impressive impersonation last night of a world leader whose country should be listened to. Her speech to the United Nations was a defiant bid to change the subject from Brexit for her domestic audience. More intriguingly, it was a sneak preview of the kind of role Mrs May hopes Britain will play on the world stage once Brexit is history.
She echoed President Trump on the risks of mass migration and the need to reform the UN, but scolded him on trade and climate change. She led calls to “reclaim the internet” from terrorists and fired two well-aimed broadsides at Russia.
The subtext of the speech was a demand that…

Madrid must use argument not force to avoid a national break-up
Spain is stumbling into its worst constitutional crisis since the end of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. The province of Catalonia’s headlong rush towards independence challenges the very roots of Spain’s existence as a unitary state. Yet the government of Mariano Rajoy, in trying to head off a Catalan breakaway, is pursuing strong-arm tactics that are likely to backfire when the province votes in a referendum in ten days’ time. He is fuelling a crisis rather than extinguishing it.
Catalonia, which once made up more than half of the territory of the Kingdom of Aragon, has long nurtured the dream of independence. Spain’s Second Republic in the 1930s extended to the region a measure of autonomy but that status was quickly extinguished by Franco. Under…

The first week of university should not be a bacchanalian bonanza
The most urgent philosophical question new undergraduates tend to face is: just because you can spend your first week at university drinking heavily and pretending to have fun with people you do not know and may not want to, should you feel obliged to?
The question is not, unfortunately, rhetorical. This is the time of year when legions of young adults, often with splendid A-level results but little experience of life, are invited to acquire some by means of a marathon of forced jollity.
Freshers’ week doesn’t have to be like this. Indeed, it shouldn’t be. There is a lot to take in on arrival at university and a lot that can go wrong. In a worst-case scenario too much booze leads to unwanted sexual…

 Sir, Daniel Finkelstein’s suggestion that the Conservative Party take inspiration from Robert Reich’s latest book, Saving Capitalism, makes a great deal of sense (“Blue-sky thinking that could save the Tories”, Comment, Sep 20). The real question is whether the Conservative Party can or will listen to him. I have my doubts.
For one thing, many Tories will look at the post-election polling which suggests that, if anything, they, rather than Labour, can now claim to be the party of the working man and woman — especially in the predominant private sector.
For another, Conservatives have never gone in much for book-learning, preferring the supposed wisdom of experience and the eternal verities — one of which, particularly once they’d promoted Margaret Thatcher to be their patron saint,…

Without accompanying visuals, this celebration of the music in Jim Jarmusch’s films wasn’t much more than a random bunch of songs
September 21 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
★★☆☆☆There was a fundamental design flaw in this celebration of the music in Jim Jarmusch’s films: no films. There was black-and-white footage of buildings at the beginning, but nothing from Down by Law, Mystery Train or any of the American director’s other stylish, unhurried classics.
Music is a huge component of Jarmusch’s movies. To remove the films from the music and not contextualise it in any other way was to leave the concert without narrative thrust, resulting in a random bunch of songs that, unless you were a Jarmusch nut, did not have any real cohesion.
It did, however, give an excuse to stage some great performances. Mulatu Astatke is a 73-year-old Ethiopian vibraphone and conga player whose “Ethio jazz” classic Yekermo Sew was used…

As freshers week looms, we investigate the best universities for the student who wants a Dutch master with their degree
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
You never forget the collection that you learn from. I was a student at Edinburgh University. Armed with our little folding stools, we would be led to the Scottish National Gallery, plonked down in front of Botticelli’s serene Virgin, Raphael’s Holy Family or Rubens’s rumbustious Feast of Herod. The university did not have an outstanding art collection of its own, but set in the heart of a capital with a host of fine collections — backed up by a superlative public library dedicated to fine-art books — it was transformed.
A first year spent racing, movement by movement, from Michelangelo to Malevich, was a revelation. It was where I found the enthusiasm that has fuelled me ever since. And whenever I see one of the…

Loung Ung helped the star during her split from Brad Pitt. Now Jolie has made First They Killed My Father, a film about her friend’s own ordeal in Cambodia
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
The actress and film director Angelina Jolie and the Cambodian-born writer Loung Ung have been close friends for 17 years, but you won’t find them hugging it up on the red carpet like other glamorous female celebrities.
With their shared love of humanitarian work, the duo are more likely to be found in some of the world’s poorest countries or hanging out in T-shirts and sweatpants in Jolie’s kitchen, drinking tea.
In a rare exception they were pictured recently at the Toronto and New York premieres of First They Killed My Father. The Netflix film is based on the memoir Ung wrote about her family’s struggle to survive during the devastating reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.

Deborah Ross: What we didn’t learn from London Fashion Week and never will,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
THE THURSDAY COLUMN
Deborah Ross
This month’s issue of Not-OK! magazine, my publication for women who would be open to self-improvement if only they could self-improve sufficiently to give it a go, focuses on what we didn’t learn from London Fashion Week, which is significant, given we paid such scant attention. We do, in fact, have a reporter in the field — we’re no Mickey Mouse operation! — but as the reporter said, “I felt so overwhelmed by ennui I stayed home and watched reruns of Peep Show instead.” This reporter is now subject to the disciplinary procedures that would be in place if only we could be bothered, or could find it in our hearts to be even a little bit cross.
We therefore, alas, cannot report with any…

Catalonia: nationalists call for permanent street protests to ensure independence referendum,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 21 2017, 12:00pm, The Times
A leading Catalonian nationalist group has called for permanent street protests to ensure that a referendum on independence goes ahead after the Madrid government made a series of arrests to try to halt the ballot.
The call from Catalan National Assembly came hours after the paramilitary Civil Guard arrested 14 members of the regional government and officials, siezed ballot papers and raided the homes of people suspected of organising the banned vote on October 1.
The Assembly, a driving force behind the independence movement, called on supporters to meet outside a courthouse where some of those detained were due to appear today in Barcelona and to bring tents.
Adria Alsina, a spokesman, said that protestors would “stay until all the prisoners were released”.
He said…

Germany’s first black African MP is battling against a racist campaign to unseat him in a general election that he has described as the “most aggressive since 1945”.
Karamba Diaby, 55, settled in Communist East Germany after winning a scholarship from his native Senegal, and became MP for Halle in 2013 for the Social Democratic Party (SPD).
Mr Diaby, who married an east German and has two children, has faced racism in the past but launched legal action for the first time last month against people who abused him on the Facebook page of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD).
Factors behind the outpouring of hatred include a more hostile atmosphere towards immigrants following Angela Merkel’s decision to admit a million asylum seekers. Mr Diaby’s…

Florian Philippot, a deputy chairman of the Front who wanted to modernise the party, said that he was slamming the door after Ms Le Pen stripped him of his post as chief of strategy and communications yesterday. His departure threatens to split the party.
“They told me that I was [now] deputy chairman of nothing,” he said. “I don’t care for ridicule and I’ve never liked doing nothing so of course I am leaving the National Front,” he said on France 2 television. Mr Philippot, 35, was…

As it became clear that Daniela Ramírez, a nursery school pupil found by sniffer dogs, was still alive, firefighters quietly raised their fists into the air.
They did so in silence, for fear of missing the cries of other children trapped in the rubble of what was once the Enrique Rébsamen school in Mexico City.
Firefighters carefully lifted the toddler from the wreckage a little after sunrise yesterday. The discovery provided a glimmer of hope that the dozens of teachers and young children trapped inside may yet be saved.
Hundreds of rescue operations took place across the city after Tuesday’s 7.1-magnitude earthquake, which struck southeast of the capital, but it was the drama unfolding at the Enrique Rébsamen school that captured the world’s attention, broadcast…

Left-wing extremists are suspected of carrying out an arson attack on a police station in France to coincide with protests against President Macron’s labour law reforms today.
About 50 vehicles were destroyed in the blaze that began in the early hours in the car park by the gendarmerie in Grenoble in eastern France. A police officer was hospitalised after inhaling smoke, but his life is not thought to be in danger.
The incident came with unions holding nationwide protests against Mr Macron’s reform, and it increased concerns that violent groups may seek to sow chaos.
The fire in Grenoble, which detectives said was started deliberately, occurred two days after another arson attack on a police station in Limoges, central France. An anarchist group calling itself…

Iraqi armed forces began the final assault of their campaign to recapture Islamic State territory with a dawn attack on Hawija.
The town and its surrounding villages, a long-term hotspot of jihadist activity about 40 miles from Kirkuk, are entirely surrounded, including by Kurdish troops to the north.
It is one of the last two pockets of Isis-held territory in Iraq. The Iraqi Security Force (ISF) and pro-government militias moved on the other pocket, in western Anbar near the Syrian border, on Monday.
The army’s ability to fight on two fronts is a sign of how it has improved as a fighting force since it fled the Isis surge in summer 2014, Brigadier General Robert Sofge, a senior officer with the anti-Isis coalition Operation Inherent…

South Korea confirmed a plan to send $8 million worth of aid to children and pregnant women in North Korea, risking further accusations of “appeasement” from the United States.
Seoul’s unification ministry confirmed that it would supply food, vaccines and medical equipment through the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) and the World Food Program, although the timing of the aid has not been decided and will depend on the state of relations between the two Koreas.
“We have consistently said we would pursue humanitarian aid for North Korea in consideration of the poor conditions children and pregnant women are in there, apart from political issues,” the unification minister, Cho Myong-gyon, said.

The Trump administration’s pledge to protect its allies in Asia from North Korean missiles rests on defence systems that have cost hundreds of billions of dollars but remain unproven against the kind of salvoes Kim Jong-un has threatened to launch, exports have warned.
President Trump used his maiden speech to the UN this week to threaten to “totally destroy” North Korea if it launched an attack, a warning that the regime’s foreign minister described as the “sound of a dog barking”. James Mattis, the defence secretary, made another promise: that the US would intercept North Korean missiles that posed a threat to America or its allies.
Experts say, however, that America is yet to demonstrate that its Aegis and Thaad systems could shoot down a…

A Chinese court has banned a state hospital from forcing a homosexual man to undergo conversion therapy to try to make him heterosexual, marking a legal victory for gay rights advocates.
The plaintiff, identified as Yu Hu, was forcibly sent to the psychiatric ward of his local hospital in the central city of Zhumadian by relatives after his wife found that he was in a relationship with another man.
He was preparing to divorce her, but instead found himself inside the facility where he was stripped naked, mocked and forced to take medication.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies were planning to launch a military assault on Qatar before President Trump intervened and persuaded them otherwise, it has emerged.
Mr Trump acted amid fears that the diplomatic rift, sparked when Qatar’s neighbours severed ties with the kingdom, accusing it of supporting terror, was about to escalate into a regional war.
Mr Trump intervened after Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain had imposed a blockade on the tiny Gulf state, according to Bloomberg.
The four allies closed air and shipping routes and expelled all Qatari nationals, prompting the most serious crisis in the Gulf in decades.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both Sunni-majority nations, wanted to change the Qatari regime, accusing it of aligning itself…

Violence against Burma’s Rohingya Muslims will foment extremism which could threaten Asia and the world unless it is stopped quickly, the US vice-president has warned.
Mike Pence said that President Trump wanted “strong and swift action” from the UN security council to end the military’s “terrible savagery, burning villages and driving the Rohingya from their homes”.
The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa), whose attacks on government outposts last month prompted the military’s brutal campaign, are at pains to distance themselves from Islamist extremism. Observers have long warned that some of the Rohingya who have been oppressed for decades would eventually turn to violence.

A veteran Canadian conservative MP has apologised for referring to the country’s environment minister as “climate Barbie”.
The term is used by the far-right media to belittle Catherine McKenna, who said that its use proved that sexism was “alive and well” in Canadian politics.
Justin Trudeau, prime minister, admitted yesterday that women found parliament a “nasty place to work”.
Gerry Ritz, an opposition MP and former agriculture minister, deleted a tweet he posted alongside a report that no major nation was on course to meet targets from the Paris climate change agreement. “Has anyone told our climate Barbie!” Mr Ritz wrote, provoking a storm of criticism on Twitter.

The storm unleashed maximum sustained winds of 155mph, making it the strongest to hit Puerto Rico since 1928, and crashed into the US territory with a force that residents likened to bomb explosions.

Mr Macron, a fair English-speaker compared with his monolingual predecessors, was subjected to online censure and sarcasm for breaching a double convention, which holds that heads of state refrain from domestic politics abroad and speak French in public.
The notoriously private president, who has refused to give an interview to French television since his election, mused on his marital life and his indifference to street protests in a private session with CNN at the UN general assembly.

The supreme court of Kenya has heavily criticised the body responsible for organising the country’s presidential election, casting doubt on its ability to hold a rerun next month after “disturbing” violations in the first poll.
Three judges said that the decision by the Independent Elections and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to declare President Kenyatta the winner of the original election on August 8 had been illegal since it relied on “dubious” ballot papers and “opaque” counting.
The judges rejected the commission’s claims that it had struggled to operate the electronic system because of signal problems. Kenya’s deputy chief justice, Philomena Mwilu, said that the court’s order for the commission to open its servers had given it a “golden opportunity” to debunk claims by the opposition leader,…

Iraq is holding more than 1,400 foreign wives and children of Islamic State fighters who surrendered as Kurdish forces closed in on one of the jihadists’ last strongholds in the country.
The women and children, who are said to include citizens of Turkey, China and former Soviet Union states as well as a small number from France and Germany, surrendered along with up to 200 men and teenage boys outside Tal Afar, near Mosul, last month.
Human Rights Watch said that the men and boys were separated by Kurdish troops and had since disappeared. The women and children are being held at an Iraqi military detention camp.
The government has vowed to prosecute all Isis militants. Haider al-Abadi, the prime minister, said Linda Wenzel, 16,…

"Terrorists arriving unseen on boats from Tunisia, Italy fears","Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Italy is braced for so-called ghost boats bringing refugees from Tunisia, raising fears that terrorists are landing on Mediterranean beaches.
Investigators believe that 5,000 Tunisians have sailed on small boats to Sicily, Lampedusa and Linosa since June, recalling the 2011 exodus during the Arab Spring. Prosecutors suspect some of the ghost boats, which slip onto Italian beaches at night, have been loaded from ships masquerading as fishing boats.
Many of the Tunisians sail from Bizerta and Sfax in Tunisia and vanish as soon as they land in Italy, leaving wet clothes on the sand. In August a sweatshirt was found with the slogan “Haters Paris” and a picture of an upside-down Eiffel Tower, believed to be a reference to the terrorist attacks there in 2015.

A South Carolina primary school teacher has been suspended after setting homework for her ten-year-old pupils to justify the actions of the Ku Klux Klan in the Civil War.
The teacher, Kerri Roberts, was placed on leave by administrators at the school in Irmo, a suburb of Columbia, the South Carolina capital.
The protest began after Tremaine Cooper posted a photograph of the worksheet on Facebook, explaining that his nephew, a black boy, was given the assignment. “He’s home crying right now,” he wrote. The pupils were asked to imagine that they were members of the race-hate group. The youngsters were told: “You are there . . . You are a member of the KKK. Why do you think your treatment of African-Americans is justified?”

It had been an exciting day for President Trump at the United Nations general assembly, during which he threatened to “totally destroy North Korea”. Later he sent out messages of support to Mexican earthquake victims, but there was still one last task that he wished to accomplish before bed.
On Tuesday, at 10.41pm New York time, he sent a final sarcastic tweet for the night responding to the mockery aimed at him at television’s biggest night of the year. “I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night — the worst ever,” he wrote. It was clear that he was gloating rather than sympathising because he added, in a reference to Hillary Clinton’s notorious campaign comment about his supporters: “Smartest…

Great white sharks have laid siege to one of Australia’s most popular beaches two days after an 18-tonne humpback whale was buried beneath the town’s shoreline.
Residents had expressed worries that oil from the dead whale — even after it was buried — would lure big sharks. Their concerns were vindicated yesterday when shark detectors spotted 21 great white movements near Nobbys Beach at Port Macquarie, a holiday town 250 miles north of Sydney.
Swimmers and surfers have been warned to stay out of the water just as eastern Australia prepares for what forecasters say may be the hottest September weekend on record.
“I definitely won’t be swimming in the water — absolutely not,” said Geoff Shelton, a senior skipper of the Port Macquarie Marine Rescue…

Large advertisements featuring Melania Trump and the slogan “Just imagine how far you can go with a little bit of English” have been removed from hoardings in Croatia after she threatened legal action.
The posters were part of a marketing campaign by a private English language school in Zagreb, which tried to persuade Croats to learn English by referring to the Slovenian-born first lady.
Lawyers for Mrs Trump, 47, did not accept an apparent joke about her English, which she delivers with a heavy accent. They demanded that the adverts, showing Mrs Trump giving a speech standing before a fluttering US flag, be removed immediately.
“I am satisfied with the fact that the school admitted that they violated the law and that they are ready…

Barack Obama is making one-hour speeches to investment banks for up to £400,000, signifying something of a change of heart.
Weeks before he entered the White House in 2009, Mr Obama said that he had not run “to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street”. Last month, however, he is understood to have received $400,000 for speaking in New York to clients of the asset manager Northern Trust Corporation. This month he was to be paid the same by Cantor Fitzgerald, the investment bank.
A spokesman for Mr Obama said that he had given several speeches that were “true to his values”. The proceeds had helped him contribute $2 million to programmes in Chicago offering “job training and employment opportunities…

Government borrowing dropped last month to its lowest level for any August since 2007 as the public finances continued to improve more rapidly than expected.
The deficit in August was £5.7 billion, £1.3 billion lower than last year, the Office for National Statistics said and below forecasts of £7.1 billion. For the first five months of the financial year borrowing has fallen by £200 million to £28.3 billion, also the lowest in a decade.
If current trends persist economists said that borrowing for the whole of 2017-18 could be as much as £10 billion less than the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast in March. August’s outperformance followed a similar surprise in July, which delivered the first surplus for the month in 15 years.

Dorothy Thompson, one of a handful of female chief executives to run a large UK-listed company, is to step down as chief executive of the power giant Drax after 12 years in charge.
Ms Thompson, who helped to steer the FTSE250-listed operator of Britain’s biggest coal-fired power station towards a future based on renewable energy, will leave the company at the end of the year. Will Gardiner, currently chief financial officer, will take over as chief executive from January 1.
Drax, which generates about 7 per cent of UK electricity and runs a coal and biomass-fired power plant near Selby in North Yorkshire, said it was seeking a replacement for Mr Gardiner, who joined the board in 2015. He was formerly chief financial officer at…

Barclays led the way, however, advancing 5p to 260½p after the comments by analysts at the US bank.

The Financial Reporting Council is vulnerable to potential conflicts of interest and is at serious risk of regulatory capture as a result, some investors argue. More than 40 present and former Big Four partners sit on its main board or other key committees.
The pressure for transparency came after the FRC raised eyebrows in Westminster and beyond after concluding on Tuesday that KPMG had not fallen significantly short of standards in its audit of HBOS, the bank that then went on to require £29 billion of…

Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp have taken the first step towards merging their European steel operations in a move that could lead to the loss of 4,000 jobs and may have profound repercussions for British steelworkers.
The companies, which signed a memorandum of understanding yesterday on creating a 50-50 joint venture, will review their joint operations in 2020 if the deal goes ahead.
The overhaul of the European market comes after long-running speculation over the future of Tata’s Port Talbot steelworks.
The combined group would have a workforce of 48,000 at 34 locations, but the two groups estimate that 2,000 management and administration jobs will go, along with up to 2,000 production jobs.
The cuts will be “jointly shared” between the two companies and they pledged…

In fact, Port Talbot was thrown into turmoil, swamped by a global production glut as China’s huge urbanisation began to slow and saddled by a legacy pension scheme from its days as British Steel.
Now it is the furnace next door, No 5, whose future is playing on the minds of Tata’s 8,500 UK workers. Tata and Thyssenkrupp have said that they will review their combined operations in 2020, but by that…

Wannabe welders are all over YouTube. Arc length, torch angle and shielding your rod are key tricks of the trade. And all top advice, too — not least the last one.
But nowhere is there a video guide to fusing the European steel activities of Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp — even though the idea’s been knocking around for yonks. True, it’s not strictly a welding job (yet), starting out as a mooted 50-50 joint venture. Yet you’d think someone would have already had a go at modelling it in their kitchen, what with it involving a mere 48,000 workers, shipments of 21 million tonnes a year and €15 billion of annual sales.
It’s the duo’s answer to Chinese steel dumping: the sort that drove India’s…

Since then he has parted company with Andy Parker, the chief executive, and warned that under new accounting rules last year’s profits were actually a third lower than reported.

The Commons’ work and pensions committee is to launch an inquiry into how the “freedom and choice” reforms are working in practice, in particular over concern that they are exposing vulnerable people to fraud.
Frank Field, chairman of the committee, said that “a new breed of pension crooks” had grown up to try to part people from their retirement savings. The committee will also investigate wider concerns that people are not getting the best value from their savings and that too many of them may be risking poverty in old age because of the temptation to splurge.

However, despite the surge, a strong euro meant that Inditex, which makes most of its clothes in Europe, had a slightly lower-than-expected gross margin in the second quarter and analysts said that its first-half net profit of €1.37 billion was a small miss on forecasts.

Such countries will not be able to rely on cheap labour to attract much-needed manufacturing business once advances in technology make it cheaper to set up factories run by robots in developed nations, it says in a report.
The organisation suggests that the introduction of advanced robotics, 3D printing and smart automation are changing the criteria used to decide on factory locations. Companies that were influenced by the prospect of inexpensive labour are beginning to favour places that can take better advantage of new technologies.
This raises the prospect of manufacturing returning to rich nations, where goods are made closer…

President Macron’s government admitted yesterday that it had devised a cynical-sounding strategy to exploit Brexit by wooing banks from London with cuts to payroll taxes.

The French capital hopes to attract up to 10,000 financial services industry jobs from London after Brexit. French officials believe that institutions will need to move operations to the Continent to retain access to EU markets.

“It’s completely unjustifiable [that] a large and successful company is receiving a government grant of several hundreds of thousands of pounds at taxpayers’ expense,” Mark Littlewood, head of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said. “Politicians should be ensuring a level playing field for all businesses, not picking winners.”

Eurosceptics have been predicting the demise of the euro since before the single currency was even launched. For 25 years, they have been warning that it is doomed to failure, that it is a “burning building with no exits”. Its supposed imminent collapse was one reason why some Brexiteers said it was essential that Britain quit the EU. Others argued that the only way for the eurozone to save itself was to turn into the superstate of Eurosceptic nightmares complete with mutualised debt and fiscal transfers, riding roughshod over national sovereignty.
This narrative has suffered many setbacks over the past few years and last week it suffered another when Standard & Poor’s restored Portugal’s sovereign debt rating to investment grade, triggering a sharp rally in…

Robin Pagnamenta
Ever tried selling a used electric car? It’s not much fun. The technology is evolving so quickly that the prices of vehicles even only a few years old are tumbling with alarming speed. A Nissan Leaf that set you back £26,000 new three years ago might fetch less than £7,000 today.
Used electric vehicles pose specific challenges, above all degrading batteries that can hobble a car’s range and ability if they are not properly cared for. And replacing a battery that has suffered too many rapid charges is expensive. A replacement for GM’s Chevrolet Bolt could cost £12,000, more than 40 per cent of the cost of a new vehicle.
Such considerations probably were not foremost in Michael Gove’s mind when he set out plans…

Shoppers shrugged off rising prices and lingering Brexit worries last month to spend far more than expected.
Retail sales rose by 1 per cent between July and August as consumers spent more despite higher prices, according to the Office for National Statistics.
Households appear to be weathering the inflation squeeze, allaying fears of a sharp, consumer-led slowdown. The forecast had been for a meagre 0.2 per cent increase; July’s sales growth has been revised up to 0.6 per cent.
As the pound jumped by almost one cent against the dollar yesterday to $1.3606, just short of Monday’s post-referendum high of $1.3616, economists said that such strong spending would make an interest rate rise more likely. The Bank of England has signalled that a rise might…

Rivals set to overtake UK growth,"Our site uses cookies. By continuing to use our site you are agreeing to our cookies policy.

Britain will fall to the bottom of the advanced economy growth league next year as the country is overhauled by Japan, Canada, France, the United States and Italy, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
As inflation takes a toll on consumer spending and Brexit uncertainty dents business confidence, the UK will drop from the second fastest growing G7 economy in 2016 to the second slowest this year and the slowest in 2018, the think tank for wealthy nations predicts.
Britain’s decline, as seen by the OECD, is relative. It has left its forecasts for British growth across the two years unchanged since June at 1.6 per cent in 2017 and 1 per cent in 2018, but has upgraded Europe and the world…

About 480 jobs will be cut at Mitie as the struggling outsourcer responds to a series of setbacks including profit warnings, restated accounts, the overhaul of its board and regulatory inquiries.
In an update on its turnaround programme, Mitie said that it expected costs of the so-called Project Helix to rise to £24 million in the year to the end of March, up from a previous estimate of £15 million. Operating expenditure has risen as Mitie reassures key customers about contracts and invests in new skills, such as data analytics.
Perhaps ironically, the company is outsourcing some of its accounting and finance functions, as well as automating administrative work in HR, simplifying management in its engineering and cleaning divisions and stripping out about 50 entities…

Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates in November for the first time in a decade, but they also believe that it will be making a mistake.
A survey of 50 economists by Reuters found that 31 think that the Bank will increase rates at its next policy meeting, compared with only three of 59 polled in September. Nevertheless, 35 of 47 respondents said that now was not the right time.
Sonali Punhani, at Credit Suisse, claimed that the Bank had “misdiagnosed the amount of slack and growth potential in the UK economy”; Elizabeth Martins, at HSBC, described the thinking as perhaps “a little premature”.
Robert Wood, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, compared a rate rise now with the European…

Large companies are diverting investment overseas as they scale back domestic spending plans amid concerns about Brexit, according to a report by the Bank of England.
Business investment has been depressed by the lack of clarity about a future trade deal and the Bank said that companies were “favouring direct investment overseas” to take advantage of improving conditions abroad.
The report is likely to put more pressure on the government to secure a transition agreement with the European Union and to outline its trading plans.
“There were some reports of firms, particularly larger corporates, favouring direct investment overseas. And uncertainties regarding the UK’s future trading arrangements continued to deter investment for some firms,” the Bank said.
“There had also been further reports of funds flowing…

The owner of B&Q and Screwfix says that the pace of the transformation in its business has been “quick and impactful”, even though its first-half sales and profits have fallen.
Kingfisher has reported sales of just over £6 billion, down 1.3 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the six months to July 31. Its statutory pre-tax profits fell by nearly 6 per cent to £402 million, while its underlying pre-tax profit was up slightly, by 0.9 per cent, at £440 million.
Much of the decline was a result of another disappointing performance from its French business, where Castorama and Brico Dépôt continue to struggle in a competitive DIY sector. Kingfisher said that like-for-like sales in France were just over £2.2 billion, down 4.6 per…

Market report

Grand ambitions can be a good thing, but not when the sceptics start to doubt that they can be realised. Thus shares in Metro Bank fell sharply yesterday amid growing concern that the lender’s growth momentum is destined, inevitably, to slow.
“We remain sceptical of Metro Bank’s ability to replicate the pace of current growth as it expands nationally in the UK,” Macquarie told its clients, beginning coverage with an “underperform” rating. Its analysts put forward a target price of £27 and “remain unconvinced” that the company has an “enduring competitive advantage” on its rivals.
Arguing that Metro’s return on equity target of 14 per cent by 2020 is too ambitious, the Australian investment group calculated that, to succeed, it would require 40 per cent…

Shares in Babcock International have come under pressure of late as the company has been lumped in with the rest of the business outsourcers. They include Interserve, which put out a shocking profit warning last week, and Capita, which has had to restate its earnings sharply downwards because of a change in accounting rules. Indeed, there are few in the sector, other than Babcock, that have not given some sort of profit warning over the past couple of years.
Another factor is the potential influence on defence spending were Jeremy Corbyn to be elected prime minister, given that Babcock gets 60 per cent of its revenues from defence, though not all from the UK. Disregard the Corbyn factor and the above seems hardly fair. Indeed,…

With its menu chalked on to a blackboard and homebaked goods displayed on a marble countertop, Luminary Bakery looks at first glance like just another trendy independent coffee shop in north London. Yet this a business apart. For one day a week, Luminary’s kitchen is a bustling hive of activity as some of the capital’s most disadvantaged young women are taught how to bake, and much more besides.
The bakery is the brainchild of Alice Boyle, who set it up in 2015 as a spin-off from Kahaila, a charity that runs programmes for women. The organisation, which is based in Stoke Newington, has three functions: the training programme, the café and a wholesale business that make cakes and traybakes for coffee shops and corporate clients.

The news comes after months of speculation that House of Fraser was being deprived of investment by its owner and was struggling to keep up with competitors on the high street.

The share purchase, expected to take his stake to about 20 per cent, is a personal investment made by the family, a statement from Volcan said.
Yesterday Mr Agarwal denied any plans to make a bid for the company and said that Volcan was “supportive” of Anglo American’s existing management and board.

Mark Sampson sacking leaves us with as many questions as answers, writes Matt Dickinson

When Mark Sampson was interviewed to become head coach of the England women’s team, he was asked if there was any wrongdoing the FA should know about. Inevitably, he said not. A box was ticked and, on Sir Trevor Brooking’s watch, a job offer made.
That was late 2013. It took four years for Sampson’s past to catch up with him yesterday, with his abrupt sacking for inappropriate behaviour towards female players. Brooking, who retired from his role as director of football development in June 2014, told The Times last night: “I was there and he interviewed fine but it would have been the HR people that looked into all the background stuff. Certainly nothing surfaced at that stage that I was aware of.”

Seán O’Brien believes that the British & Irish Lions should have whitewashed New Zealand in the summer and has blamed Warren Gatland and the coaches for the touring side’s failure to do so.
The Ireland flanker, who started all three Tests in the 1-1 series draw against the All Blacks, questioned whether Rob Howley was the best choice for backs coach because Owen Farrell and Jonathan Sexton did a better job of running the Lions’ attack.
O’Brien criticised the Lions coaches as a whole for getting the team’s preparations wrong before the first Test, which New Zealand won, and the third Test, which ended in a 15-15 draw.

Women’s head coach fired after ‘unacceptable’ behaviour — before he was given England job

The FA was under fire last night over its handling of Mark Sampson after the organisation’s chief executive admitted he knew almost two years ago that there were concerns about the behaviour of the England women’s head coach, who was sacked yesterday.
Tracey Crouch, the sports minister, called the situation “a mess” as the FA sought to explain how Sampson had stayed in his post for almost four years despite whistleblowers raising worries within months of him taking over the national side in December 2013.
It can be revealed that senior FA figures in the England women’s set-up were warned about Sampson’s reputation for inappropriate behaviour with players even before his appointment was confirmed. The person who delivered the warning told The Times: “Everyone in…

The FA would save itself a lot of grief if it learnt the concepts of transparency, due diligence and decisive leadership. Regardless of its belated action in sacking Mark Sampson yesterday, the governing body of the English game finds itself embroiled in another scandal because it tried to hide a shameful family secret. When will it ever learn?
If Martin Glenn, the FA chief executive, was made aware of the safeguarding issue two years ago, why did he not act then? The FA’s safeguarding unit investigated Sampson’s conduct at Bristol Academy, found some of it “unacceptable” in terms of “breaching the boundaries between coach and player”, according to Glenn, yet he was cleared to carry on as head coach of the England women’s team.

The Game Daily: Rangers must prove they are moving forward in the Old Firm derby
Imagine Celtic and Rangers as two neighbours permanently tuned in to what the other is up to, each with an ear pressed up against a glass on either side of a dividing wall.
Celtic have won six consecutive league titles, have posted a 74 per cent growth in revenue to a record £90.6 million, and just shared a stage with Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Rangers haven’t won a major trophy for six years and were knocked out of Europe two months ago by Uefa plankton from Luxembourg. Glasgow’s giants are in different places. Yet they still remain inseparable, forever psychologically tethered by the need to master each other.
The first Old Firm game of the season is at Ibrox on Saturday. Brendan Rodgers…

The Chile forward’s wanted to join Manchester City for £60 million on transfer deadline day but the deal fell through when Arsenal failed to negotiate a £92 million deal to replace him with the Monaco midfielder Thomas Lemar.
Sánchez is in the final year of his contract and the chances of him renewing with Arsenal appear remote.

Brian Cookson has suffered a crushing defeat in his efforts to be re-elected as president of the International Cycling Union.

Chelsea were, by the end, brimming with young talent, much of it from their academy. It was a riposte to those who wondered if any of the club’s managers would take note of their highly impressive youth system.
Antonio Conte prefers ready-made, mature players but he cannot ignore the talent at his disposal when he is constantly bemoaning his busy schedule. He cannot even overlook Kenedy, the player who many assumed would not play for the club again.
This was experimental Chelsea, and while Conte is not always comfortable with chopping and changing, his meddling worked wonders last night, earning the club another home tie in the next round against Everton. Chelsea were, mostly, fluid and comfortable in spite of nine changes that the Italian…

What’s that famous saying? Death, taxes and sweeping changes in the early rounds of the EFL Cup. As the remainder of the Premier League teams entered the Carabao Cup this week, supporters will not have been surprised to see a different set of players to those they watched at the weekend. At least those who turned up – the attendance of 44,064 for Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Doncaster Rovers last night was the lowest ever for a competitive first-team fixture at the Emirates Stadium. But which sides made the most alterations?
Wholesale changes (9+)Almost half of the teams in action this week made nine changes or more to the side they played in their previous fixture. Aston Villa and Arsenal were the only teams…

It would be tempting to focus on Theo Walcott’s fine winner, Alexis Sánchez’s continued sharpening or the sight of two 18-year-olds in Josh Dasilva and Joe Willock making their Arsenal debuts. It would be worth celebrating Doncaster Rovers’ admirable persistence that almost brought the League One side late reward. But the real story here was Jack Wilshere.
This was Wilshere’s first start for Arsenal since May 15, 2016. He has been injured, away on loan at Bournemouth, and used from the bench so this meant so much. He was given plenty of time in possession here, a luxury he will not be permitted against West Bromwich Albion next Monday, but this tireless 90-minute shift felt an important moment, a step back on the road that…

For the first time in almost a month, Ronald Koeman could toast an Everton victory, a clean sheet and the presence of two of his strikers on the scoresheet.
The Everton manager did not look like he will be swayed too much by the manner of the performance that eventually swatted aside Sunderland to leave his side with a fourth-round trip to Chelsea.
The youthful enterprise of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, and a late cameo from substitute Oumar Niasse, managed to stem a run of four defeats and point towards a solution to some of the problems that have been anchoring Everton. “In a difficult time period, the best medicine is scoring goals and winning games,” Koeman said.
It speaks volumes for the Dutchman’s standing that Niasse…

A number of Manchester United fans risked the wrath of their club and the FA after strains of a banned song about Romelu Lukaku were audible during their Carabao Cup match against Burton Albion last night.
A small group of supporters in the Stretford End was heard singing the offending song, which has been condemned for its racist connotations, defiantly chanting: “We sing what we want.”
The Times exclusively revealed that the song, which makes reference to the size of the Belgium striker’s penis, was targeted by Kick It Out, the anti-discrimination campaign group, for its “offensive and discriminatory” lyrics and for reinforcing racial stereotypes about black men after footage emerged of it being chanted in the win over Basel.

The holders Manchester United will travel to Swansea City in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup while Tottenham Hotspur welcome West Ham United to Wembley for an all-London affair.
José Mourinho’s side beat Championship Burton 4-1 at Old Trafford last night to secure their place in the draw.
Chelsea, 5-1 winners against Nottingham Forest in the third round, will welcome Everton — who beat Sunderland 3-0 — to Stamford Bridge.
Tottenham, who narrowly beat Barnsley at their temporary home 1-0 on Tuesday, host Slaven Bilic’s side in what is arguably the standout tie of the round. Spurs only attracted a crowd 24,000 on Tuesday but the club will hope for a much larger attendance against Premier League opposition.

Fifa’s investigation into potential breaches of youth recruitment regulations by Chelsea revolves around the trials given to Bertrand Traoré and Domingos Quina.
The world governing body looked into Chelsea’s signing of Traoré last year, but The Times has learnt that those investigations were never concluded. Fifa has widened the probe to include Quina, as well as examining whether Chelsea complied with its regulations, which state that all clubs must inform their domestic leagues of foreign trialists who are under 18.
Traoré signed for Chelsea on January 1, 2014, the earliest date possible after his 18th birthday in September 2013, but Fifa is looking into his involvement at the club before then.
There were reports at the time that he joined Chelsea’s academy from Auxerre in…

El Dorado lives on. Instead of the fabled hidden South American city of immense wealth, rugby has the United States of America. Rugby Union’s “unexposed” market of huge potential. Like El Dorado it is no more than a rumour. There seems a certain kind of madness afoot. For all the talk of crowd size in the recent game in Philadelphia, the Holy Grail is television money. Alex Corbisiero, the former British & Irish Lion, reckons rugby has “a huge market”. He is NBC’s analyst. It would be news if he said anything else.

It was fitting with the style of Jake LaMotta that he was the last man standing from a truly golden age of middleweights, Ron Lewis writes. LaMotta, a man immortalised by Robert De Niro’s portrayal in the film Raging Bull, died at the age of 95, having outlived all of his rivals.
LaMotta was a legendary hardman best remembered for his six battles with Sugar Ray Robinson in the 1940s and 1950s. He was the first man to defeat Robinson, in 1943, the only opponent in Robinson’s first 132 fights to have his arm raised. Robinson was the finest boxer in history, which gives some idea as to LaMotta’s standing.
The former world middleweight champion died at a nursing home in Florida on Tuesday from…

September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Jürgen Klopp’s attempts to improve the Liverpool defence are being hampered by Dejan Lovren’s late withdrawal from matches.
The Croatia centre back has been pencilled into the starting line-up for the club’s past two games — the Premier League draw against Burnley and Tuesday’s Carabao Cup defeat away to Leicester City — but has then been forced to pull out because of a back complaint.
Liverpool have not wanted to take any risks, so Ragnar Klavan was a late call-up last Saturday, with Lovren able to take his place on the bench. But he missed out altogether against Leicester, with Klopp forced into a reshuffle in which Jon Flanagan came in for his first start for the club since the final day of the 2015-16…

Andrew Strauss has hit back at Sir Ian Botham’s claims that England have created a conflict of interest by having selectors who are also county directors of cricket.
Botham, the Durham chairman, criticised the system of cricket transfers after Paul Coughlin left the county to join Nottinghamshire, where Mick Newell, the director of cricket, is also an England selector. Keaton Jennings, the England batsman, is set to follow that path at the end of the season.
“He [Botham] is 100 per cent wrong if he’s implying that Coughlin has gone to Nottinghamshire on the back of one of our selectors saying he’s got a better chance of playing for England coming to my county,” Strauss, the director of England cricket, said.

At first, Jürgen Klopp seemed genuinely surprised.
It was put to him last week that one of his faults as Liverpool manager is that he is too trusting of his players, ready to see potential when Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola might hammer on the boardroom door screaming for change.
“People say that?” replied Klopp before pausing for thought and offering some admirable honesty. “That’s the risk when you get a manager. We are like we are. I believe in trust.
“I trust people until they give me an opportunity, or a possibility, not to trust them any more. That’s how I understand life.”

Sunderland born and bred, a product of the club’s excellent academy, a leader in the making, 24 years of age and an all-rounder of considerable potential, it is easy to see why Durham should be so agitated at losing Paul Coughlin to a rival county. Not just any old county, either, but Nottinghamshire, a county with a Test ground who ought to be able to nurture their own cricketers without poaching from elsewhere.
Even so, the argument that his move should prompt cricket to introduce a football-style transfer system, or even a transfer window, lacks logic. The game, in its financial state, can neither sustain one, nor should it want to introduce a system that would further strengthen the competitive advantage enjoyed by bigger, wealthier…

Boxer played by Robert De Niro in Raging Bull whose 106-fight career was overshadowed by the brutality of his private life

The night in 1949 that Jake LaMotta beat Marcel Cerdan to win the world middleweight title, a man called Harry Gordon walked into the party in his hotel room. “The Bronx Bull” thought he had seen a ghost. As far as he knew, ten years previously he had bludgeoned Gordon to death with a lead pipe and stolen his wallet, which was empty. It transpired that reports of the bookmaker’s demise had been premature.
LaMotta cried that night, he later wrote: for Gordon, for raping an 18-year-old girl in the Bronx, and for the violence he had meted out to the women in his life.
Although LaMotta held his world title for only two years, he did so in one of boxing’s golden ages, unmatched…

Wayne Rooney’s website tells its own story. From the headlines of “Wayne rejoins Everton Football Club” and “Wayne’s first goal back at Goodison Park”, the news section of officialwaynerooney.com now leads with the headline “My statement of apology”.
It is not how he envisaged his return to his boyhood club, in mid-September, and in this week’s podcast our panel discuss the player’s guilty plea to a drink-driving charge that prompted the aforementioned apology. Matt Dickinson says that Rooney owes Everton, having been brought in “partly on the ‘role model to the younger players’ ticket. And within weeks, he’s spending a night with the police.”

Antonio Conte says Chelsea need David Luiz to play against Atletico Madrid with a broken wrist. Luiz sustained the injury in Sunday’s goalless draw with Arsenal when he clattered into the advertising hoardings at the end of the first half.
The Brazil defender continued in the second half until he was dismissed after 87 minutes for a reckless tackle on Sead Kolasinac which saw him given a three-game suspension.
Luiz missed last night’s 5-1 Carabao Cup win over Nottingham Forest and will also be ineligible for the Premier League clashes with Stoke and, crucially, Manchester City. But Conte expects Luiz to play at Atletico in the Champions League next Wednesday.

Great Britain have been handed a tough task in the first round of next year’s Davis Cup after being drawn away to Spain.
It is undoubtedly the worst possible draw that Leon Smith’s team, who are seeded third, could have faced. The tie will almost certainly be played on clay and will start on February 2, only five days after the conclusion of the Australian Open in Melbourne.
Given Andy Murray’s hip troubles this year, it would be unwise for the British No 1 to switch from hard courts to clay within such a short time and then back to hard for the start of the ATP Masters 1000 series in March. Clay is a surface on which Kyle Edmund, the world No 45, is…

Martin Bain is a fan of cycling and the Sunderland chief executive has drawn upon that affection as he confronts a job and a “s***storm,” rolled into one. He has heard how Chris Froome boils down the Tour de France to individual days, so that a dizzying task somehow becomes smaller and more manageable and he has tried to do the same.
Within three weeks of Bain assuming his role at the Stadium of Light last July, Sunderland lost Sam Allardyce to England and, far from being an exception, that pace of change has become the norm. “Change” is the word he uses to describe his 14 months on Wearside. “It’s all I’ve done,” he said; three managers, 70 redundancies, relegation, a failed attempt to…

Toby Roland-Jones, who had left the field in the middle of an over just before close of play on the first day, has had a precautionary scan on a side strain. It proved inconclusive, and the England seamer will have further tests today.
The 29-year-old did not bowl during the rest of Lancashire’s first innings or when they batted again — needing 221 to win, a target which was reduced to 175 with nine wickets intact by the close — but was able to bat at No 8, scoring nine runs off 15 balls faced. Roland-Jones will take no further part in this match on account of the stiffness in his side.

In his final match at the Kia Oval, Kumar Sangakkara drew on that innate sense of timing that the great batsmen possess to make his eighth hundred in nine County Championship matches this season.
In doing so, he not only became the first player to make that many centuries in a campaign since Marcus Trescothick also hit eight for Somerset in 2009, but more importantly he piloted Surrey, who started this round of matches in third, towards a potentially match-winning lead that should guarantee their Division One status.
Somerset were very much in the game when Ben Foakes was fourth out at 169, caught behind off the impressive Peter Trego. Sangakkara, however, never looked in any difficulty on a pitch that had flattened out from…

A career-best nine for 65 by Rory Kleinveldt and Richard Levi’s bullocking 115 have given Northamptonshire the upper hand in a game they have to win.
Nottinghamshire need only to avoid defeat to seal their promotion from Division Two and that of Worcestershire, but victory for Alex Wakely’s side will turn the last week of the season into a five-furlong handicap with Northamptonshire closing on the long-time favourites. Northamptonshire travel to Leicester and Nottinghamshire visit Hove in the final round that starts on Monday.
Kleinveldt added five more wickets to the four he had claimed on the first evening, an effort that gained his side a first-innings lead of 43. Even those heroics faded as the home side scored 270 in 52.2 overs, Levi putting…

Genial wildlife artist turned conservationist best known for his elephant paintings, prints of which outsold Canaletto in the Sixties
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Rejected as a game warden in Africa and turned down as a student by the Slade School of Fine Art, David Shepherd went on to paint Wise Old Elephant, one of the best-known sitting-room prints of the 1960s. It depicts a magnificent grey beast staring sternly forward beneath a darkening sky in the yellow grass of the African bush.
Such is the work’s popularity that half a century later an estimated 100,000 copies gaze down from above fireplaces around the country. It even hung on Del Boy’s wall in Only Fools and Horses. And Elephants at Amboseli was the bestselling print in Britain in 1967, beating a Canaletto.
Critics were less enthusiastic, deriding Shepherd’s representational art as “nature studies”. Initially he claimed not to care,…

Avuncular Geordie who was the BBC’s longest-serving regional TV presenter and the unruffled subject of a Noel Edmonds prank
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Live television is perilous, as any presenter can testify. Sometimes the pitfalls are not accidental. In 1989 Mike Neville was the victim of a “Gotcha” played by Noel Edmonds on Noel’s House Party. He was tricked into believing that there was a technical fault preventing Wogan being screened and he had to ad lib on live television for seven minutes.
“It’s only Terry Wogan,” he said while taking messages from the control room in his ear. “Is he back from holiday yet? You don’t know? He is. What a pity. I preferred Ben Elton myself.”
Eventually he was put out of his misery when Edmonds walked on to the set to reveal that Neville had not been on air. Neville’s calm, unruffled presentation had been…

Today we have dealt the enemy another of those smashing blows which he must be coming to dread. The long period of preparation and suspense is over. We have struck, and, so far as can be seen at present, with shattering force and complete success. We did not seek to go far. The extreme depth to which we sought to penetrate was about one mile, but that mile we have overrun, and grasped, and hold. Already the enemy has been counter-attacking. He is counter-attacking now.
It is rash to prophesy, but I have been this morning where the wounded and prisoners were coming along the roads and have talked with some scores of our men, and victory is in the air. The advance included all…

Why has this hurricane season been so catastrophic? Harvey, Irma and Maria have been unbelievably destructive. And there are signs that the remains of tropical storm Lee could blow up into another hurricane in the wake of Maria.
Conditions in the Atlantic have been perfect for creating the most powerful hurricanes. The tropical seas are warmer than usual, serving as fuel for hurricanes. In addition, the winds high in the atmosphere have been light, enabling the towering thunderclouds of the storms to soar into the atmosphere unmolested. In El Niño years these winds tend to be strong and sheer off the tops of storms before they become dangerous. However, there has not been an El Niño this year.
A strong west African monsoon has helped…

The actress and film director Angelina Jolie and the Cambodian-born writer Loung Ung have been close friends for 17 years, but you won’t find them hugging it up on the red carpet like other glamorous female celebrities.
With their shared love of humanitarian work, the duo are more likely to be found in some of the world’s poorest countries or hanging out in T-shirts and sweatpants in Jolie’s kitchen, drinking tea.
In a rare exception they were pictured recently at the Toronto and New York premieres of First They Killed My Father. The Netflix film is based on the memoir Ung wrote about her family’s struggle to survive during the devastating reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.

The new urban brewing obsession is all about apples. Prosecco drinkers might even like it, says Harry Wallop

The smell hits you first. It is quintessentially English and rural: thousands of apples, some starting to rot, in large wooden crates are giving off that fecund scent of autumnal orchards.
I am not in Somerset but in Bermondsey, right in the heart of London. From this lock-up, under the railway arches of London Bridge, I can see the Shard a few hundred yards away. This is the home of Hawkes Cidery & Taproom, which not only makes cider in this distinctly urban setting but sells it by the pint to office workers and hipsters wearing rolled-up trousers.
It was opened in the summer by Simon Wright, 34, who has been making cider for the past three years — but never in the centre of London.…

At bedtime Judith Newman overheard her teenage son in pillow talk with his dearest female friend. “Will you marry me?” Gus asked. Newman held her breath, waiting for the answer. “I’m not the marrying kind,” came the reply in a cool adult female voice.
Her son persisted. Not now, he meant, he was only 13. But when he was grown up. She again declined, this time with a bit more sass: “My end-user agreement does not include marriage.”
Gus was not talking to a real woman. It was, for him, something better. He was talking to Siri, iPhone’s voice-controlled virtual assistant that many of us think of as little more than a dialling mate when we’re in the bath.
Not Gus. Gus is autistic and…

Armed with our little folding stools, we would be led to the Scottish National Gallery, plonked down in front of Botticelli’s serene Virgin, Raphael’s Holy Family or Rubens’s rumbustious Feast of Herod. The university did not have an outstanding art collection of its own, but set in the heart of a capital with a host of fine collections — backed up by a superlative public library dedicated to fine-art books — it was transformed.
A first year spent racing, movement by movement, from Michelangelo to Malevich, was a revelation. It was where I found the enthusiasm that has fuelled me ever since. And whenever I see one of the…

Private school pupils say the funniest things — and then use Instagram to tell everyone about it
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
It’s tough being posh. Not only do you risk trending on Twitter every time you step into Waitrose (see #overheardinwaitrose), now your little darlings are in danger of being stereotyped too — at least that’s what one London deputy headteacher thinks.
Loren Macallister, of the Surbiton-based independent school Shrewsbury House, wrote this week that affluent parents need to teach their children the value of money. If not, she warns, they may feed into less-than-generous media portrayals of private school students. Heaven forfend!
Perhaps she had seen the Instagram account @overheardatprivateschool. With more than 23,500 followers, the account documents the choice musings of students at posh schools. “What’s Primark?” asks one such budding philosopher. “Can we cook lobster linguine on Duke of Edinburgh?” cogitates another.

This month’s issue of Not-OK! magazine, my publication for women who would be open to self-improvement if only they could self-improve sufficiently to give it a go, focuses on what we didn’t learn from London Fashion Week, which is significant, given we paid such scant attention. We do, in fact, have a reporter in the field — we’re no Mickey Mouse operation! — but as the reporter said, “I felt so overwhelmed by ennui I stayed home and watched reruns of Peep Show instead.” This reporter is now subject to the disciplinary procedures that would be in place if only we could be bothered, or could find it in our hearts to be even a little bit cross.

We say All the antioxidant-rich ingredients in African Botanics’ sleekly packaged products are sourced from the Fynbos region on the Western Cape of South Africa. This gel is my favourite in the range; a rather eye-watering £50 for 60ml, but totally worth it. The blend of arnica flower, comfrey, shea butter and marula, as well as essential oils such as clary sage and eucalyptus, smells rather heavenly and has that magic ability to make skin feel cold and hot at the same time. It’s incredibly lightweight — be careful not to squeeze too hard or it’ll all shoot out —…

If you were a hot, French, loaded 31-year-old international football star, what thing or person would you envy most?Is this a trick question?
What do you think?Dunno. David Beckham? He’s hot and rich and good at football, but doesn’t have to get up at 5am to train any more.
Very clever, but no. The answer is Julian Assange.Eh? Mr Wikileaks? That strange pale man locked in a Knightsbridge basement with a cat and a treadmill for company?
It’s an embassy, not a basement. And you seem to be forgetting his most exciting company . . . Right. Of course. All those titillating Ecuadorean diplomats.
No! She’s blonde, busty, spent the Nineties in a teeny red swimsuit . . . Err . . .
Pamela Anderson!…

FIRST NIGHT
This expansive exhibition proves the artist’s success belongs more to the history of publicity than to the history of art
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★☆☆Earlier this year, one of Jean-Michel Basquiat’s canvases went under the hammer for more than $110 million, making him not only the most financially successful black artist, but also one of the world’s top-selling artists full stop. The Brooklyn-born son of a Haitian father and a Puerto Rican mother, Basquiat started his creative career as a tearaway with a spray can, and had turned, by the age of 20, into an art world superstar. His eye-catching, poetic scrawls captured the attention of 1980s New York. Within the space of a few years, his paintings — scratched, sprayed and scribbled, blotched, gashed and scrawled — were selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Within a decade he was dead. It’s a sensational story and Basquiat: Boom for Real…

FIRST NIGHT
It’s so packed with incident and ideas that it’s sometimes almost breathless — but its ferocious grip never slackens
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★★☆It’s hard to believe now that The Sun was ever regarded as a “stuck-up broadsheet”. But that, in James Graham’s dazzling drama, is how Larry Lamb dismisses the newspaper in 1969, as its new owner, a young Rupert Murdoch, tries to talk him into becoming its editor over a lobster dinner. The rest, of course, is tabloid history, and Graham — a prodigious talent whose latest play, Labour of Love, is about to open in the West End theatre next door to this one — relates it in page-turning style.
More instantly compelling than any clickbait and sharper than a paper cut, Ink transfers from the Almeida in a production by Rupert Goold that is thoughtful as well as thrillingly dynamic and rambunctiously entertaining. It’s…

Set in a disused factory, this vivid portrait of the imperilled steel industry is mournful and defiant
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★★☆“It’s always the bastard same,” says a veteran of Port Talbot’s steelworks as he argues with his workmates over how best to keep their jobs alive. “Built by men in overalls, destroyed by men in suits.”
We will have to wait and see how the just-announced merger between the steelworks’ Indian owner, Tata Steel, and the German manufacturer Thyssenkrupp will confirm or deny his worst fears. Yet what this site-specific show from National Theatre Wales already does, with great aplomb, is let us in on the ground floor. It gives us a vivid impression of what it’s like to be part of this community, which is so dependent on the 4,000-odd jobs that steel brings.
As we follow its performers around this large empty factory,…

first night
Textures wet and dry, perfumes sweet and bitter, and the rough lick of terror and desire were realised with startling precision
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★☆☆Stripped of their names, the protagonist and antagonist of the second half of Alessandro Baricco’s novel Senza sangue speak without inflection in the composer and conductor Péter Eötvös’s compact operatic adaptation. The only props in Róbert Alföldi’s spare, suspenseful Armel Opera Festival production are a table, two chairs, and a gun.
Written as a prologue to Bluebeard’s Castle, Eötvös’s 2015 two-hander uses a reduction of Bartók’s orchestral palette of bone, charcoal, pewter and ash to illustrate the emotions that Baricco’s characters wish to conceal. The stalls seats were cleared from the auditorium of the Hackney Empire, creating a vast orchestra pit for this one-off performance, the first full staging of Senza sangue in the UK.
Muted brass, creeping strings and the chill of brushed gongs…

Sara Pascoe’s adaptation has its moments, but in the end she sabotages her own efforts to make this more than just having a bit of a laugh
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★☆☆☆I would have bet a new £10 note that I wouldn’t begin with this, but needs must and so: it is a truth, universally acknowledged, that a single playwright in possession of a good story must be in want of, er, something more than this. This adaptation by the comic Sara Pascoe of Jane Austen’s revered novel has its moments, but in the end she sabotages her own efforts to make this more than just having a bit of a laugh.
The Bennet family, with five daughters who must be married, were always borderline sitcom but now they become totally two-dimensional. Mrs Bennet is shrewd, her husband henpecked and the youngest two daughters provide an endless girlie squealathon. The dancing at the endless balls is…

Highs and lows of a magnificent woman in her flying machine
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
★★★☆☆She is on stage when we arrive, sitting in an armchair. Emily Stilson was an aviatrix and wing walker but now she is in her 70s, an old woman enjoying her own company. But what’s this? Lights flash. Blackout! Now it gets very noisy. Suddenly Emily is airborne, circling, tumbling above us, lit up in the dark centre swathe of this traverse staging.
She is saying words, words, words but it is all, to use the technical term, gobbledegook.
Juliet Stevenson is Emily, the star of this austere play by the American Arthur Kopit, who wrote it originally for radio in 1977, months after his father had suffered a debilitating stroke. He based the character on two women he had met at his father’s rehab…

Jack Dee returns to his hangdog shtick for a new sitcom about a suburban couple who relocate to the country — but it’s just too nice
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
Bad Move ITV ★★☆☆☆
The Detectives: Murder on the StreetsBBC Two★★★★☆
Jack Dee does misery superbly, but in Bad Move I find him not miserable enough. This comedy feels too innocent, too gentle a vehicle for Dee, whose darkness can be a luminous joy. It’s all a bit too — what’s the unlikely word I’m looking for? — ah, yes: nice.
The premise is good: a couple leave the city for a new life deep in the Yorkshire sticks and find that, far from the smug rural idyll painted on TV shows, it’s your basic nightmare. Dee got the idea watching Escape to the Country and wondered what happened when the cameras leave. Steve and Nicky (Dee and Kerry Godliman) can’t get a wifi signal…

Viewing guide, by Joe Clay
Tribes, Predators & MeBBC Two, 9pmGordon Buchanan is in Ethiopia to reveal the curious and complex relationship its people have with hyenas. The hyena is neither cat nor dog — its closest relative is actually the mongoose. It has one of the strongest bites of any animal, and despite its relatively small size (the largest spotted hyenas weigh about 90kg) can take down a wildebeest. They have even been known to kill lions. Most fearsome predators are revered, but the hyena is reviled. However, this is not the case in some parts of Ethiopia. In this orthodox Christian country, the people believe that hyenas ward off the Devil. This is why they are tolerated and can live relatively peacefully…

DINNER TONIGHT
September 21 2017, 12:01am, The Times
I once spent a fascinating couple of hours wandering around Barcelona’s famous La Boqueria food market, transfixed, in particular, by the bean stall. White beans, black beans, speckled beans, kidney-shaped beans and wide flat oval beans, even cooked beans for quick suppers. My own bean stash is mainly in cans, perfect for simple dishes like this. Serve with crusty bread and butter, over green beans, or pile over garlicky bruschetta. It is also a good accompaniment to chicken or lamb.
Serves 2Prep 20 minCook 25 min
MethodHeat one tablespoon of oil in a heavy-bottomed medium-sized pan and stir in the lardons. Cook, stirring occasionally, over a medium heat while you halve, peel and chop the onion. Stir the onion into the bacon and cook,…
