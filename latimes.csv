Here’s what earthquake magnitudes mean—and why an 8 can be so much scarier than a 6,"We know an earthquake is severe when it has a high magnitude number. The 1985 quake that devastated Mexico City was an 8. The quake that shook central Mexico this week was a 7.1.
But what exactly is magnitude?
Basically, magnitude is a number representing the total energy released in an earthquake, said seismologist Lucy Jones. The energy released is determined by how much rock moves and how far it moves.
Here’s an explainer for what magnitudes mean, and how that relates to the shaking we feel. This explains why an 8 could be so much more terrifying than a 6.
For each whole-number increase in magnitude, the seismic energy released increases by about 32 times. That means a magnitude 7 earthquake produces 32 times more energy — or is 32 times stronger — than a magnitude 6.
A magnitude 8 releases 1,000 times more energy than a magnitude 6, but it releases that energy over a larger area and for a longer time, Jones said.
Originally, the definition of magnitude related to seismograms, in which machines used an ink stylus to record rapid motions on a rolling drum of paper that would measure shaking. Magnitude was about how big the waves were on a seismogram at a particular distance from the epicenter. On the so-called Richter scale, a magnitude 8 on a seismogram was 10 times bigger than a magnitude 7.
But the Richter scale was eventually scrapped in favor of what is known as the moment magnitude scale. The moment magnitude scale measures the movement of rock along the fault, and accurately measures larger earthquakes, which can last for minutes and affect a much larger area; the Richter scale did not accurately record such quakes, Jones said.
The U.S. Geological Survey has a calculator that can help you make these calculations. So, for instance, a magnitude 8.2 — probably the strongest earthquake that could hit Southern California on the San Andreas fault — would produce an astonishing 178 times more energy than the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake in 1994.
Magnitude is important, but a key factor is where a quake strikes. The ones most people care about strike under or near heavily populated areas.
Generally, earthquakes of magnitude 6 and above are the ones for concern. When nearby, they can cause shaking intensities that can begin to break chimneys and cause considerable damage to the most seismically vulnerable structures, such as non-retrofitted brick buildings.
Earthquakes of magnitude 7 and above can overturn heavy furniture and inflict considerable damage in ordinary buildings.
Let’s consider the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
That earthquake was a magnitude 6.7. But the shaking intensity varied by where you were when it hit.
If you were in Northridge, right on top of where the earthquake fault moved, you faced what’s known as intensity 9 shaking, defined by the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale as “violent” — enough to shift a structure off its foundation.
Yet the downtown Los Angeles region got far less intense shaking from the same earthquake — intensity 6 or 7, where damage is negligible in buildings of good design and construction.
Vast swaths of Southern California would feel intensity 10 shaking, or extreme shaking — an earthquake that no one alive today has experienced in this region.
Yes. Here’s the USGS’ explanation:
Intensity 10: Extreme — Some well-built wooden structures destroyed; most masonry and frame structures destroyed with foundations. Rails bent.
Intensity 9: Violent — Damage considerable in specially designed structures; well-designed frame structures thrown out of plumb. Damage great in substantial buildings, with partial collapse. Buildings shifted off foundations.
Intensity 8: Severe — Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable damage in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse. Damage great in poorly built structures. Fall of chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned.
Intensity 7: Very strong — Damage negligible in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in well-built ordinary structures; considerable damage in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys broken.
Intensity 6: Strong — Felt by all, many frightened. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster. Damage slight.
Intensity 5: Moderate — Felt by nearly everyone; many awakened. Some dishes, windows broken. Unstable objects overturned. Pendulum clocks may stop.
Intensity 4: Light — Felt indoors by many, outdoors by few during the day. At night, some awakened. Dishes, windows, doors disturbed; walls make cracking sound. Sensation like heavy truck striking building. Standing motor cars rocked noticeably.
Intensity 3: Weak — Felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings. Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck. Duration estimated.
Intensity 2: Weak — Felt only by a few persons at rest, especially on upper floors of buildings.
Intensity 1: Not felt — Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable conditions.
The USGS switched its definition of magnitude from the Richter scale to the moment magnitude scale in the late 1990s, Jones said.
The Richter scale, developed in the 1930s, was named after American seismologist and physicist Charles Richter.

Kim Jong Un says 'mentally deranged' Trump will 'pay dearly' for threat against North Korea,"North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong Un escalated a dangerous war of words between Pyongyang and Washington on Friday, calling President Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” and warning that the U.S. will “face results beyond his expectation.”
Kim, in an exceptionally rare, 500-word statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, personally hit back against Trump’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.
In the speech, Trump called Kim “Rocket Man” and vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea if the U.S. were forced to defend itself or its allies. In August, Trump had said that if Pyongyang continued to threaten the U.S., North Korea “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.”
Kim criticized Trump’s U.N. speech for worsening North Korea-U.S. tensions, according to the statement. He added that U.S. president “is arousing worldwide concern.”
“After taking office Trump has rendered the world restless through threats and blackmail against all countries in the world,” Kim continued. “He is unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician.”
Trump’s remarks have convinced Kim “that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last,” he said.

President Trump delivered a forceful inaugural speech to a packed United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, a sprawling 42-minute address — warlike at times, flowery at others — that challenged some tenets of U.S. foreign policy.


With the cavernous hall packed so full that scores of people jammed...
Kim presided over North Korea’s largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 amid harsh U.N. sanctions and a chorus of international censure. He has launched dozens of missiles in pursuit of the technical ability to strike the continental U.S. with a nuclear-tipped warhead.
Although North Korean state media refer to Kim constantly, they rarely carry full statements in his name. Analysts said the statement underscores North Korea’s concern that the U.N. served as the platform for Trump’s remarks, despite the country’s often-belligerent rhetoric.
“It’s quite significant [to North Korea] that the U.S. president made these remarks officially before the international community,” said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. “That setting is meaningful. I think Kim Jong Un himself and the North Koreans themselves thought, ‘This requires a different kind of response.’”
“Don’t forget there’s a domestic context to that speech,” he continued. “Kim is speaking to an international audience, but he’s also speaking to a domestic audience. He’s saying, ‘This guy just threatened to totally destroy us — to destroy you, North Korea. And I’m not gonna stand for it.’”
North Korea’s ambassador to the U.N., Ja Song Nam, reportedly protested Trump’s U.N. speech by leaving the room.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, will give a speech at the U.N. on Friday. “If [Trump] was thinking he could scare us with the sound of a dog barking, that's really a dog dream,” he told reporters Wednesday.
Ri was then asked about “Rocket Man,” Trump’s new nickname for Kim.
“I feel sorry for his aides,” he responded.

When Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders visited Beverly Hills last May, he made a full-throated appeal for California to “lead the country” and pass a pending state proposal to establish single-payer healthcare.
On Friday, he’ll return to California for a San Francisco speech trumpeting his own higher-stakes plan — a bill to drastically overhaul the nation’s healthcare system by covering everyone through Medicare.
The push for single-payer, in which the government pays for residents’ medical care, has already rattled California’s political landscape. Now, the Sanders measure brings an additional jolt, elevating the issue to a national debate that has implications for the future direction of the Democratic Party and early jockeying in the 2020 presidential race.

Two top candidates for California governor have been touting their healthcare wins. Here's what they really did,"Gavin Newsom and Antonio Villaraigosa are depicting themselves as Democratic healthcare visionaries as they campaign to become California’s next governor.
To prove his healthcare mettle, Newsom points to Healthy San Francisco, a first-of-its-kind universal system adopted while he reigned as the city’s mayor in 2006. Newsom’s work on the program helped him land an endorsement from the influential California Nurses Association, and a boast or two will surely punctuate his speech at their convention on Friday as hyper-partisan politics intensify over efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and implement a national single-payer plan.
Villaraigosa holds up the creation of Healthy Families, legislation he authored as a state assemblyman in 1997 that provided coverage for the children of California’s working poor.
Both programs are considered successes, benefiting the lives of tens of thousands of Californians. While the two Democratic candidates played pivotal roles, Newsom and Villaraigosa were not the sole inspiration for the programs they now cite as their signature achievements on healthcare. And some will not let them forget it.
That includes former San Francisco County Supervisor Tom Ammiano, author of the ordinance that evolved into Healthy San Francisco. His resentment about Newsom taking credit for the program is still palpable.
“He was very nervous about [the program] and tried to undermine it as best he could,” Ammiano told the Los Angeles Times recently. “He did sign it, and since then he’s been taking credit for it.”
The two candidates, who along with state Treasurer John Chiang are among the most widely known in the race, have also been quick to take shots at each other over their roles in the creation of the programs.
“Gavin came in kicking and screaming,” Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, said of Newsom’s support for Healthy San Francisco.
Newsom brushed aside Villaraigosa’s work on Healthy Families, saying all it really did was funnel federal money for children’s healthcare to California counties, including San Francisco, that implemented the coverage.
“It was table stakes,” said Newsom, who is currently the state’s lieutenant governor. “It was something all of us were well positioned to do. And would have been foolish not to do.”
Their posturing also shows these seasoned politicians understand how hot the healthcare issue is in California.
When California voters were asked about how they’ll rank issues while they’re considering which gubernatorial candidate to support in 2018, healthcare finished second only to jobs and the economy, according to a recent poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies.
At a recent campaign stop in Fresno, an audience member asked Newsom what his healthcare policy would be if he won.
“What can we do ourselves?” Newsom said after a brief discussion about rising healthcare costs. “Well, I asked that same question as mayor of San Francisco. And everyone said, well a city can’t do healthcare. Only states or countries [can do that]. And I said, ‘Well, I don’t know about that.’ ”
In 2006, San Francisco became the first city to launch its own universal healthcare system, a program that at its peak provided affordable care to more than 70,000 uninsured residents in the city. The program gives members access to a primary and other care. It is funded by the city through income-adjusted patient co-pays and fees paid by San Francisco employers with uninsured workers.
“San Francisco has universal healthcare — regardless of preexisting conditions, regardless of your ability to pay and regardless of your immigration status,” Newsom told the crowd gathered in Fresno.
Newsom expressed concerns about the proposed ordinance that eventually became Healthy San Francisco. He worried about the impact of the fees on city businesses, according to San Francisco Chronicle story published after the initial ordinance was introduced in 2005.
When interviewed this week, Newsom argued that Ammiano’s idea amounted to a health insurance program that failed to cover most of San Francisco’s uninsured. Newsom said he authored a separate proposal focused on providing direct care, not insurance, to everyone without healthcare coverage in the city.
Mitchell Katz, who served as San Francisco’s director of the Department of Health Services Health Services when Healthy San Francisco was created, described the ultimate result as a compromise: Ammiano wanted to require employers to pay for or provide healthcare for their workers, and Newsom was pushing for a city-controlled universal healthcare system.
Healthy San Francisco enrollment dropped dramatically after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which provided insurance to many of the residents in the city program. The program currently serves about 14,000 people.
Though Villaraigosa authored the legislation that created the statewide Healthy Families, that program was also born out of political compromise.
Villaraigosa, who had authored legislation to expand Medi-Cal coverage for children, proposed doing the same with a new bushel of federal funding targeted at healthcare coverage for children. But Republican then-Gov. Pete Wilson refused, insisting that families should pay at least something based on their income to cover their child’s healthcare rather than receive care under Medi-Cal for free.
“Wilson told me straight to my face that he’d never do it,” Villaraigosa said.
Kim Belshe, who was Wilson’s state health director, credits Villaraigosa, who was the Assembly’s majority leader, for helping craft a compromise and convincing Democrats to support it.
Wilson signed the Healthy Families into law in 1997, which at the time created a $500-million program offering subsidized health insurance to more than 580,000 California children whose families were uninsured but earned too much to qualify for Medi-Cal, California’s health care program for the poor. 
After Healthy Families passed, Villaraigosa vowed to expand it into a universal healthcare program for 5.5 million California adults who were uninsured. But that never happened because of cost concerns, and in 2013 Healthy Families was folded into Medi-Cal as a cost saving measure.
Now both Newsom and Villaraigosa say they support the push for a national single-payer system. But they diverge over whether California should go solo and launch its own state-sponored program — a plan the California Nurses Association lobbied heavily for this year in the California Legislature. That plan was also shelved mostly due to cost concerns.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, champion of the Democratic movement for a national single-payer system, will be at Friday’s California Nurses Association conference to preach his Medicare-for-all gospel. Newsom is scheduled to speak just hours before him.
Villaraigosa said the estimated $400-billion price of this year’s state proposal made it unaffordable and the Trump administration would never grant the federal waivers needed to make it feasible. Newsom, who had indicated he favored the proposal, said he’s “committed to advancing that debate” on a state single-payer plan, but has stopped short of offering his iron-clad support.
Both agree that California needs to take action soon.
If President Trump and Republicans in Congress repeal Obamacare, Villaraigosa says, the state must first grapple with a potential loss of tens of billions in federal healthcare funding. He has floated the idea of allowing Californians to buy into Medi-Cal.
Newsom said he is trying to determine which aspects of the Healthy San Francisco program could be replicated statewide.
“We’re about to potentially get hit with a major, major shock to the system,” Newsom said.

"Helping young Latinos jump through hoops to stay home, in America, where they belong","It was 7 a.m. Tuesday when I pulled up to the two-story stucco building on a nondescript stretch of 3rd Street between Koreatown and Westlake.
Already, a line of sleepy-looking people stretched down the block and around the corner. Some had brought chairs, others were sitting on the sidewalk, trying to nap.
A woman who had claimed the first spot in line told me she’d arrived at 3 a.m. She was hellbent on seeing a reliable immigration attorney that day. She had come to the right place; CHIRLA, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.
Around 8, the doors opened. Young adults, all of whom had come to the U.S. as children, filed into a room that could pass for a high school study hall, with computer carrels lining the wall and an American flag in one corner. They are recipients of President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which conferred temporary legal status, but not citizenship.
Since 2012, 800,000 of these young immigrants have been able to live freely — with Social Security numbers, and two-year work permits. Then President Trump announced on Sept. 5 that he was canceling DACA. He gave Congress six months to come up with an alternative plan, and allowed the estimated 154,000 whose work permits would expire during that window to apply for one more two-year extension.
If Congress fails to act, a giant question mark will hang over the future of all DACA recipients.


They aren’t children, they aren’t perfect and — no matter what happens in Washington — they aren’t going to cower in the shadows anymore.


Some of them don’t even like the evocative label “Dreamers,” finding it as stigmatizing as the “model minority” stereotype that raises the hackles of so many...
Eden Velasco, a Department of Justice-trained advocate, welcomed the two dozen or so DACA kids and showed them the detailed intake forms they’d fill out. Unlike many of the Spanish-only immigrants served by CHIRLA, all of these folks speak perfect English. Many sound as American as Bart Simpson, without the attitude.
“If you don’t have your passport pictures, we are going to be taking them for you today,” Velasco said. “And if you don’t have your $495, we’re going to be covering those fees for you. OK?”
Silence.
“Yay?” said Velasco. It took a moment for the news to sink in; CHIRLA was not just providing some $350 of free legal advice; it was also picking up the hefty cost of a DACA renewal.
There was scattered applause.
Although these immigrants have already provided detailed information about their lives, they are asked to give it again. They must estimate their yearly income, their yearly expenses and include a brief paragraph about why they need a work permit. (“Some examples,” says the form, “can include: to pay bills, help parents, provide for family, pay for tuition, saving money for college, etc.” Not included: Because I grew up here and California is all I know.)
There is a detailed checklist on the form that helps attorneys anticipate problems. It asks for information on any “criminal problems … even if they were dropped,” whether the applicant has ever been inside a police car, fingerprinted or handcuffed; subjected to juvenile charges, teen dating violence or domestic abuse charges, stalking, sexual harassment, child abuse or neglect charges, traffic tickets, firearm possession, drug charges, shoplifting or burglary, “even if it was dismissed.”
Attorneys meet with each applicant individually to process the renewal applications, cut checks to the government and make sure forms are mailed to the right place. They try not to leave any room for error.
I chatted briefly with Eneri Torres, 26, who crossed the border with her family from Mexico City when she was 10. At South East High school in South Gate, she sold homemade tortas and taught quinceanera dancing. She has cleaned houses and pools, and studied culinary arts at Long Beach City College.
These days, Torres is a pastry chef at The Line, a hip Koreatown hotel and restaurant where Latino and Korean cultures cross. In the kitchen, she told me, she’s been struggling to perfect a recipe for forbidden rice pudding.
Torres said she once received a ticket for driving without a license (because she could not legally have one). A minor issue like that, said CHIRLA director of legal services Luis Perez, should not present an issue for her renewal.
“I was always aware of my status,” Torres said. “I had hopes for citizenship, and I had lots of friends saying, ‘I’ll marry you!’ But I thought I would spend the rest of my life working illegally.”

CHIRLA shares a building with the Mother Plucker Feather Co., which sells fans, headdresses and “loose plumes.” It’s a slightly startling juxtaposition. Every once in awhile, said CHIRLA spokesman Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a feather-clad showgirl type will sashay down the hall.
In the last two years, CHIRLA’s budget has doubled, to $7 million. It has seven staff attorneys, 14 Department of Justice-accredited legal specialists, political organizers, and many others who are devoted to preserving the rights of thousands of young adult immigrants who achieved legal status under Obama, only to watch it ripped away earlier this month for reasons that are certainly political.
The federal government will only accept applications for renewal until Oct. 5, which explains the long lines outside CHIRLA on the three days a week that the group focuses on DACA recipients. So far, CHIRLA has processed more than 300 applications, and hopes to get to 1,000.
The truth is no matter what happens to DACA, no one will voluntarily leave the United States. Why would they? This is home.
“I thought I was from here until I tried to get a driver’s permit,” said Eduardo Garcia, 25, who graduated from Fontana High School, works in a warehouse and wants to be an electrical engineer. “My mom told me, ‘It might be harder than you think.’”
Garcia has not been south of the border since he crossed into California on Christmas Day in 1991. At the time, he was 3 months old.
Even the president seems to disagree with his own policy.
“Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military?” Trump tweeted Sept. 14. “Really!”
::
The staff at CHIRLA are clear-eyed about who they can help and who they cannot.
In the early morning line, I met Angel Ruiz, a 36-year-old from Mexico who owns a mini market in Los Angeles. He became a U.S. citizen in 2008.
Ruiz had brought his 16-year-old nephew, who was fiddling with his phone nearby. The teenager, who dropped out of school in fifth grade to work in the fields in El Salvador, had arrived in Los Angeles over the summer. Now enrolled at a Los Angeles high school, he has no legal status and does not qualify for DACA.
“Everyone should have a chance,” Ruiz said.
I turned to Cabrera, who was on the sidewalk near Ruiz and his nephew, directing people to the appropriate offices inside. What can CHIRLA do to help a kid like that? I asked.
Cabrera shook his head.
“We try not to turn anyone away,” Cabrera said. “However, we are very blunt. Someone like that is at risk of deportation. There’s not much we can do.”
I didn’t have the heart to tell Ruiz. He’d find out soon enough.

Credit agency Experian says it can protect you from the 'dark Web' — sort of,"The ad opens with quick cuts of creepy-looking hackers in sinister surroundings. A serious male voice asks: “Is your personal information already being traded on the dark Web?”
Then the imagery brightens — a sunny kitchen, a family playing with a fluffy white dog. “Find out with Experian,” says a friendly female voice. “Act now to help keep your personal information safe.”
Consumers’ and lawmakers’ attention is rightly focused at the moment on the security breach involving Equifax, which left millions of people facing a very real possibility of fraud and identity theft.
But the recent ad from rival Experian highlights a more troublesome aspect of credit agencies — their use of questionable methods to spook people into buying services they may not need and, in so doing, giving the companies permission to share data with marketers and business partners.
“One of the biggest problems with credit reporting agencies is that their real customers are the banks and landlords who pay for credit reports,” said Peter Swire, a professor of law and ethics at Georgia Tech.
“Ordinary consumers are not their main market, except when the company can talk us into paying for something about our own credit history,” he said.


Even as millions of consumers grapple with fallout from the Equifax data breach, Republican lawmakers are quietly backing legislation to deregulate credit agencies and make them even less accountable for wrongdoing.


Bills are pending in Congress to limit class-action damages for violations of the...
The dark Web is a real thing. It’s a hard-to-reach part of the Internet — a network of shadowy, encrypted websites that don’t come up in normal searches and typically require special software to access.
“Because of its hidden nature and the use of special applications to maintain anonymity, it’s not surprising that the dark Web can be a haven for all kinds of illicit activity,” Experian says on its own website. “This means if you’ve ever been a victim of a data breach, it’s a place where your sensitive information might live.”
Scary.
Luckily, Experian is here with a free scan of the dark Web on consumers’ behalf. All you have to do is enter your email address.
The search box makes a stab at transparency by stating that inputting your email means you’re giving Experian permission to pitch its own products as well as “other products that may be of interest.” It also says you’re agreeing to Experian’s terms of service.
But that hardly comes close to a full disclosure of what’s transpiring. I clicked on Experian’s terms of service and found a densely written, nearly 17,600-word document — a contract the length of a novella.
Not surprisingly, this is where you’ll find an arbitration clause preventing you from suing the company — an increasingly common aspect of consumer contracts nowadays. That’s the least of your worries, though.
It turns out running a free dark-Web email scan opens you up to “advertisements or offers for available credit cards, loan options, financial products or services, or credit-related products or services and other offers to customers.”
It also exposes you to “the ability to track and collect certain consumer information specific to you,” including your credit score, loan and credit card payments, and interest rates.
The terms reveal that Experian “receives compensation for the marketing of credit opportunities or other products or services available through third parties,” which is exactly what it sounds like. You’re giving permission for the company to sell you out.
And if you make it to the very bottom of the contract — no small feat, I assure you — you’ll find this little cow chip: Even if you cancel any Experian service, your acceptance of the arbitration clause “shall survive.”
For the rest of your natural life? That seems to be the presumption.
Claudia Kubowicz Malhotra, an associate professor of marketing at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said two big problems with Experian’s pitch are that no one will read 17,600 words of fine print and that relatively few consumers have the slightest idea what the dark Web is.
“For those who may be hearing about the dark Web for the first time, it sounds ominous,” she observed. “And then it is super easy for the consumer to click and proceed with the free search.”
So is the dark-Web search worth it?
I did it and Experian listed my work email as “compromised” after finding a single mention on the dark Web. However, the company was unable to provide any details, such as what sort of site contained the reference or in what context.
On the other hand, Experian was able to say that maybe more extensive searches, including for my Social Security number, driver’s license number and credit card numbers, would turn up something more significant.
It would be happy to do this and more for just $9.99 a month.
Swire at Georgia Tech noted that Experian agreed to pay $950,000 in 2005 to settle charges brought by the Federal Trade Commission that it deceived consumers who sought free credit reports.
“This new product from Experian looks like an aggressive way for them to say something is ‘free’ when it really isn’t,” he said.
I shared my experience with Sandra Bernardo, an Experian spokeswoman, and posed a number of questions about the usefulness of a dark-Web search and the various conditions I’d agreed to.
She said the value of the free search lies in helping consumers “start on the path of learning more about the dark Web and how to better protect themselves from identity theft and fraud.”
Bernardo said the terms of service are long because they’re “meant to be as comprehensive and complete as possible.” I’d argue that if “comprehensive” means roughly the length of Franz Kafka’s “The Metamorphosis,” maybe some CliffsNotes are in order.
She denied my suggestion that acceptance of Experian’s terms, thanks to the “shall survive” clause, will last in perpetuity. Even so, Bernardo acknowledged that my agreement to the company’s arbitration provision could last years.
Finally, she noted that if you don’t like being marketed to as a result of the dark-Web scan, you can always opt out of such solicitations, although that entails multiple steps with multiple parties.
This is where I now find myself, in a position where I gave up a lot of privacy in return for a single purported dark-Web reference that Experian can’t even tell me about.
And, yes, I’ll be opting out of all that marketing, tracking and collecting.
Maybe the dark Web is a concern. To be honest, having my email address mentioned once doesn’t keep me up at night.
But Experian ratting me out to its business partners, and Equifax all but handing people’s data to hackers, those are things I could definitely live without.

Equifax won’t win any prizes for its handling of a massive security breach that potentially exposed the personal information of 143 million people to hackers.
But it was striking that of all the things that outraged consumers, the one that drew the most attention was Equifax’s inclusion of an arbitration clause in its offer of free credit monitoring.

" As Trump works the U.N., Washington focuses on Republicans' last-gasp Obamacare repeal bid ","Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington:
President Trump isn't going to let Kim Jong Un get the last word. 
The North Korean leader continued the spat between Pyongyang and Washington on Friday, calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”
The U.S. president responded with a Friday morning tweet,  labeling Kim ""a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people.""

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called President Trump ""deranged"" and said that he will ""pay dearly"" for his threats, in a statement carried by the state news agency Thursday.
The comments came in response to Trump's combative speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.
Kim said that Trump is ""unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country"" and described the president as ""a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire.""
Kim said he is ""thinking hard"" about his response, but Trump will ""pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying"" North Korea.
President Trump on Thursday announced plans for new sanctions against North Korea as he struggles to find ways to confront that country's nuclear buildup.
After threatening earlier this week to completely destroy North Korea if it uses its nuclear weaponry against U.S. territory or allies, Trump told reporters he was issuing a new executive order adding more sanctions to those that the United States and allies already have imposed.
He said the measures would target North Korea's textiles, fishing industry and shipping. In fact, sanctions against those industries are already in place, so it was not clear what was different about the additional ones.
""Do business with the United States ... or the lawless regime"" of North Korea, he said.
""We seek ... a complete denuclearization of North Korea,"" the president said. Many observers call that standard all but impossible to meet, given the progress of Pyongyang's nuclear program to date.
Trump, on the margins of the annual United Nations General Assembly, was meeting Thursday with the presidents of Japan and South Korea, the two neighbors of North Korea with the most at stake in the showdown.
Already, the U.S. and the U.N. have imposed tough economic sanctions against North Korea that eat away at its export income, imports and revenue from workers it sends overseas. But none of those measures has curbed efforts by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to develop intercontinental missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the United States.
As mainstream media outlets raised questions Tuesday about the wisdom of President Trump labeling North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” from the lectern at the United Nations, the president’s message-making sped into gear.
“Trump supporters around the country should take pride in President Trump’s strong and principled speech before the world’s leaders at the United Nations today where he expressed profound and unwavering America First principles,” Michael S. Glassner, the executive director of Trump’s reelection organization, said in an email blasted out shortly after Trump’s U.N. address.
“The President described a new vision, putting Americans first…and condemning those who support rogue nations and terrorists.”
For two weeks Trump has been in a well-publicized dalliance with Democrats, cutting deals on the federal budget and debt ceiling and seeking an agreement on immigrants who entered the country illegally as young children. At the same time, he has sought to blunt any retribution from his supporters by flooding them with messages focused on why they backed him in the first place.
President Trump extended his condolences to Mexico's president and offered assistance on Wednesday, a day after an earthquake devastated central Mexico, including the capital, Mexico City, and killed more than 200 people.
Trump and President Enrique Peña Nieto had a lengthy telephone call in the morning, according to the White House, after Trump first tweeted his concern the night before -- prompt reactions that contrasted with his tardy response to disaster in Mexico earlier this month. 
""The president offered assistance and search-and-rescue teams, which are being deployed now,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement describing the call, and ""also pledged to continue close coordination with Mexico as the two countries respond to the recent earthquakes and hurricanes."" 
Trump did not extend condolences to Mexico for a week after a deadly earthquake in the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas on Sept. 7. Trump blamed poor cellphone reception in the mountains of Mexico for the delay in reaching Peña Nieto.
Yet partly out of pique, by then Mexico had rescinded its offer to help the United States deal with damage in Texas and Louisiana from Hurricane Harvey, and focused instead on earthquake response.
Vice President Mike Pence also spoke of Mexico's plight, in remarks at the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. 
""Our hearts and our prayers are with the people of Puerto Rico and the people of Mexico,"" he said, referring to damage from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Mexico's earthquake casualties.
On Twitter on Tuesday night, Trump wrote, ""God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you.”
The latest Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would inflict ""real human suffering"" on millions of Americans, former President Barack Obama said Wednesday, speaking out in public defense of his signature healthcare reform effort.
The law has led to major increases in the number of Americans with healthcare coverage, Obama said, speaking in New York at an event on global development sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
""When I see people trying to undo that hard-won progress for the 50th or 60th time,"" he said, ""it is aggravating.""
The Republican efforts would make coverage unavailable to cancer survivors, pregnant women, children with asthma and others with existing medical problems, he said, ""without any ... common sense rationale.""
""It's certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents,"" he added. ""But typically, that's how progress is won, and how progress is maintained.""
The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would start slowly reducing the trillions of dollars in bonds it purchased to try to stimulate the economy, another milestone in the central bank's efforts to return to a normal monetary policy after the Great Recession.
The long-awaited reduction in the Fed's $4.5-trillion balance sheet comes amid great uncertainty at the central bank. There are several vacancies on the Fed board and there could be a change in leadership early next year if President Trump decides not to renominate Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen.
On top of that, the devastation caused by recent severe hurricanes could make it difficult for Fed policymakers to get a solid read on the economy in the coming weeks as they decide whether to enact another small hike in a key interest rate.
""Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship,"" Fed officials said in a policy statement Wednesday after a two-day meeting.
""Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near-term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term,"" the Fed statement said.
Late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel skewered the new Republican healthcare plan, a potentially devastating development as Senate GOP leaders struggle for support ahead of a possible vote next week.
Kimmel waded into the healthcare debate earlier this year when he choked up on TV recounting his newborn son's heart condition — and the high costs of healthcare that he can pay, but he knows other Americans cannot.
The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" host has become one of the most prominent celebrities to publicly advocate preserving Obamacare's insurance protections — so much so that Republicans themselves have aspired to meet ""the Jimmy Kimmel test.""
It says that patients like the child born with a congenital disease would get the care they need, with no caps on insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, regardless of costs.
On Monday night, Kimmel said the new bill from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) — a one-time guest on the show who coined the Kimmel test phrase — failed the standard.
""This new bill actually does pass the Jimmy Kimmel test but a different Jimmy Kimmel test,"" the comedian said in his opening monologue.
""With this one, your child with the pre-existing condition will get the care he needs if, and only if, his father is Jimmy Kimmel. ... ,"" he said. ""Not only did Bill Cassidy fail the Jimmy Kimmel test, he failed the Bill Cassidy test.""
He said: ""This guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied to my face.""
The reaction was swift and fierce, especially because Kimmel tweeted the Capitol switchboard number for viewers to call their senators urging a ""no"" vote.
Democrats and others opposed to the new bill quickly shared the message, ensuring phone lines lit up at Congress.
Cassidy, a medical doctor who has worked tirelessly on the new bill, mounted a vigorous defense Wednesday and said Kimmel was mistaken.
""I am sorry he does not understand,"" the senator said on CNN. ""Under Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson, more people will have coverage, and we protect those with pre-existing conditions.""
Experts analyzing the just-released bill, which Republicans are trying to pass before a Sept. 30 deadline, say it would more likely cut coverage for millions of Americans.
Under the plan, states that expanded Medicaid coverage for lower-income Americans with Obamacare would see their funding reduced and distributed more evenly with those that did not.
States also would have more leeway to apply for waivers from the kinds of Obamacare protections against spending caps and lifetime limits that were a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act.
Republicans have not yet secured the 50 votes needed from their slim 52-seat majority for passage.
Key GOP senators who opposed an earlier overhaul — Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) — have not said whether they will support the new bill.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has said he will oppose it, and others may join him.
Kimmel's monologue could prove pivotal in influencing the debate.
Sitting in the middle of Fifth Avenue got three congressmen hauled away by New York City police on Tuesday afternoon during a demonstration in front of Trump Tower to protest the president’s immigration policy.
Reps. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), along with New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, were among a group of about 10 protesters taken into custody, according to postings on social media.
“We’re making it clear to Trump, GOP & Dems: we will continue peaceful fight for #Dreamers & immigrants as long as it takes,’’ Guiterrez posted on Twitter in explanation of the protests.
Photographs showed the protesters sitting in the middle of the street holding a white banner, as a cordon of police stood above them. Trump was believed to be in Trump Tower after addressing the United Nations earlier in the day.
 
Amid criticism that it hasn’t lived up to its commitment to historically black colleges, the Trump administration has named Johnathan M. Holifield, a former NFL player, author and entrepreneur, to lead a White House initiative on the issue.
Advocates applauded the appointment and said they look forward to working with Holifield, who played for one season with the Cincinnati Bengals, in 1989. But some are still skeptical and called for more substantive changes, particularly a reversal of proposed budget cuts and a greater commitment to Title III of the Higher Education Act, which helps institutions of higher education support low-income students.
Holifield’s appointment was announced Monday at the annual White House conference for presidents and stakeholders at historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. Some attendees said they hoped the event would be a first step to more cooperation with the administration.
The latest Republican-led effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act has some resistance outside Washington: a bipartisan group of governors.
On Tuesday, nearly a dozen governors, including Bill Walker of Alaska, signed a letter opposing the new repeal legislation sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) that in recent days has gained momentum in Congress.
The move by Walker could influence his state's senior senator, Lisa Murkowski, a key vote who has been silent on whether she supports the new legislation. In July, Murkowski, a Republican, voted with Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), in opposition to the last Obamacare repeal effort.
Walker’s opposition comes a day after Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said he supports the legislation. (For his part, McCain, who has not said if he supports the new repeal bill, has said his vote would be influenced by Ducey’s position.)
In voicing their opposition, the group, led by Govs. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and John Kasich (R-Ohio), denounced the legislation for being crafted behind closed doors.
“Legislation should receive consideration under regular order, including hearings in health committees and input from the appropriate health-related parties,” the governors wrote in a letter to congressional leaders. 
Since the summer the bipartisan group of governors has expressed concerns about deep cuts to Medicaid in their states, which, among other things, helps provide funding for drug addiction treatment. 
On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office said that it would not be able to produce a full analysis of the Cassidy-Graham bill, including cuts to Medicaid, for several weeks.
President Trump is making a big push to revive the Republican healthcare overhaul days before a Senate deadline, dispatching Vice President Mike Pence from New York back to Washington on Tuesday to tell GOP senators: ""This is the moment.""
Senate Republicans have until Sept. 30 to pass their latest legislation, from Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, with 50 votes plus Pence as the tie-breaker. On Oct. 1, the start of a new fiscal year, the threshold reverts to 60 votes — an impossible hurdle since there are 52 Republicans and the Democratic caucus is solidly opposed.
They face building pressure from angry conservative activists pushing Republicans to keep their promise to ""repeal and replace Obamacare."" But opponents of the bill, including major medical and patient associations, have mobilized against it.
Pence, who was in New York with Trump and other senior administration officials to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting, returned to the Capitol to tell Republican senators: ""Now is the time. We have 12 days,"" according to a media pool report from Air Force Two.
Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, both phoned Pence during his flight from New York. Graham told reporters on Pence's plane that Trump had called him on Monday evening to urge action. 
Cassidy and Graham have been working to salvage the party effort for an alternative health insurance program after the spectacular collapse last month of an earlier Republican bill to undo President Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act.
Graham said Tuesday he has made an alliance with ""Darth Vader"" — referring to former Trump advisor Steven K. Bannon — for support to see the bill to passage. Bannon, who was portrayed as the villain on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" is back to running the website Breitbart, which is influential among conservatives, after being pushed out of the White House. 
""I have got Alan Greenspan, Jeb Bush and Steve Bannon"" behind this bill, Graham said. ""If anyone can do better, I'd like to meet them.""
Even though some senators have been working separately on bipartisan legislation to improve the Affordable Care Act by stabilizing the health insurance marketplace, Pence planned to tell Republican senators that House Republicans would not support those efforts.
Two senior Navy officers were fired Monday due to a “loss of confidence in their ability to command” after two collisions with civilian ships in the western Pacific killed 17 sailors at sea, the Pentagon said.
Rear Adm. Charles Williams, commander of the warships on patrol in the Asia-Pacific region, and Capt. Jeffrey Bennett, commander of guided missile destroyers in the region, were the latest leaders removed since the Navy launched an investigation last month into the deadly accidents.
Defense Secretary James N. Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon he was confident in how the Navy was examining the mistakes that have shaken the military and political leadership. In all, four U.S. warships had collisions or ran aground in the Pacific this year. 
The Navy has “a tradition of holding officers accountable, and they’ll do what they think is necessary,” he said.
In addition to the loss of life in the Navy, Mattis said he was concerned about a string of aviation crashes and other accidents during training exercises that have killed or injured more than 50 troops this year.
“We’re going to look at what happened on the demolition range and we’re going to look at what happened at seamanship on a ship and we’re going to look at what happened when an aircraft came out of the air,” he said.
A U.S. Army special operations service member was killed Thursday and several others were injured during a training incident at Fort Bragg, N.C.
A day earlier, 15 Marines were injured during exercise after their amphibious landing vehicle caught fire at Camp Pendleton.
“What has caused the compilation of these coming in?” Mattis said. “Right now I don’t have that broader knowledge.”
Mattis focused much of his comments on the Navy accidents because so many sailors died.
The Navy has fired several commanders related to the deadly collisions, including Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, commander of the Japan-based 7th Fleet that oversees all operations in the Asia-Pacific region
Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson, the Navy’s top officer, ordered a sweeping review last month to determine why trained crews on U.S. warships carrying radars and other high-tech sensors failed to avoid collisions while underway.
Richardson also announced a rare “operational pause” to give time to the Navy to assess its policies and procedures.
The stand-down was announced hours after the U.S. guided-missile destroyer John S. McCain collided on Aug. 21 with the Alnic MC, a Liberian-flagged oil and chemical tanker that is nearly three times its size.
Ten sailors were killed in the accident, which occurred at the entrance to the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, near Singapore.
Two months earlier, on June 17, the guided-missile destroyer Fitzgerald was rammed by a much larger Philippine-flagged container ship, the ACX Crystal, about 50 nautical miles from the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka, Japan. 
Seven sailors were killed in that accident. The commander and executive officer of the Fitzgerald were later relieved of command.
A guided-missile cruiser, Lake Champlain, collided with a South Korean fishing vessel on May 9 off the Korean Peninsula. Another guided-missile cruiser, Antietam, ran aground Jan. 31 and gushed oil into Tokyo Bay.
Defense Secretary James N. Mattis said Monday that the U.S. military has not attempted to shoot down ballistic missiles test-launched by North Korea because they have not been on a trajectory to hit U.S. or allies’ territory.
The comments come after the underground test of a nuclear bomb earlier this month and days after North Korea launched its second missile in less than a month that flew over northern Japan.
The intermediate-range missile was launched Friday near the isolated nation’s capital, Pyongyang, soaring for about 2,300 miles before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The test demonstrated that the U.S. territory of Guam is now in attack range.
Mattis said these launches are testing the U.S. military to see how much North Korea can get away with before triggering a response.
“They are intentionally doing provocations that seem to press against the envelope to see how far they can push without going over some kind of line in their minds that would make them vulnerable,” he told reporters at the Pentagon.
“The bottom line is: The missiles, were they to be a threat – whether it be to U.S. territory, Guam, [or] obviously Japan’s territory -- that would elicit a different response from us,"" he said.
The U.S., Japan and South Korea have missile defense systems surrounding North Korea, including at sea. Analysts have stressed that knocking a missile out of the sky with interceptors is difficult and has been often been described as “hitting a bullet with a bullet.”
North Korea has conducted 15 missile tests in 2017 and more than 60 since Kim Jong Un took power in 2011.
Thus far, U.S. response to the launches has been sanctions, which have largely cut off Pyongyang from the rest of the world economy, and “show of force” exercises.
On Sunday, U.S. Air Force flew B-1 bombers and F-35 stealth fighter jets over the Korean Peninsula, along with allied fighter jets from South Korea and Japan.
New Yorkers generally hate the week of the U.N. General Assembly, when heads of state from around the world gather in the city, snarling traffic and inconveniencing those who actually live here.
This year it means the return of New York's not-so-favorite local son, President Trump, who received just 18% of the vote in his hometown. Police have started barricading a vast swath of Midtown, stretching from the United Nations headquarters to Trump Tower, which is about 15 blocks away on Fifth Avenue.
The building, where Trump maintains a triplex penthouse, was surrounded Sunday by police cars -- and strangely, an effective if low-tech barricade of New York City garbage trucks. Helicopters whirred overhead as a motorcade arrived.
This will be Trump’s third and probably longest trip home since his inauguration. The last two times Trump visited the city, he was greeted by large crowds of protesters with signs reading, “New York Hates You.""  This trip is unlikely to be much friendlier.
The New York Police Department and Secret Service would not answer questions about the number of personnel providing security for the visit or the costs involved. Trump has said previously that he avoids coming home because of the security costs.
He arrived Sunday from Bedminster, N.J., where he has a weekend home at one of his golf clubs.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Sunday that Iran would respond strongly to “any wrong move” by the United States on the multilateral nuclear deal struck in 2015.
President Trump has threatened to declare Iran in violation of the landmark agreement next month, which could pave the way for additional U.S. economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
Iranian leaders have accused Trump of trying to sabotage the deal in which Iran agreed to shelve its nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions.
“Every day they [American officials] play a new trick or expose a new side of their viciousness,” Khamenei said at a graduation ceremony at a police academy, Mehr News reported.
The ongoing war of words comes as world leaders prepare to gather at the United Nations this week. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has said Iran has met its obligations under the nuclear agreement and is cooperating with international inspectors.
The Trump administration has sent mixed signals on the nuclear agreement, which Trump once called “the worst deal ever.”
Last week, Trump effectively endorsed the deal by extending one of its terms, a waiver on certain U.S. sanctions against Iran. But he also accused Iran of violating “the spirit of the deal” and renewed a threat to declare that Iran was not complying with its terms, a move that would give Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.
“They have violated so many different elements, but they’ve also violated the spirit of that deal,” Trump said last week. “And you will see what we’ll be doing in October. It will be very evident.”
Trump administration officials have argued that Iran must allow U.N. inspectors access to military sites, but Iranian leaders have rejected the idea, saying it would violate their country's sovereignty.
On Friday, firebrand cleric Ahmad Khatami said in the closely watched weekly sermon at Tehran University that “nowhere in the text…of the [nuclear deal] is it mentioned that military sites can be inspected.”
The Trump administration is considering closing down the U.S. Embassy in Cuba after nearly two dozen American diplomatic staffers or family members suffered health effects that were blamed on suspected sonic attacks, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday.
“We have it under evaluation,” Tillerson said in an interview aired on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” when asked about calls by some GOP lawmakers to shutter the embassy in Havana. “It’s under review.”
An embassy shutdown would mark an abrupt reversal of the warming ties between the two nations since diplomatic relations were restored in 2015. President Trump has criticized the diplomatic opening, but he has not moved to break ties again.
Tillerson called the health problems stemming from the apparent sonic attacks “a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered,” adding: “We’ve brought some of those people home.”
Those health effects have reportedly included hearing loss, nausea, headaches and ringing of the ears.  
Five Republican senators have urged Tillerson to shut down the U.S. embassy and expel all Cuban diplomats from the United States unless the Havana government takes “tangible action.”
Two Cuban diplomats stationed in Washington have already been expelled in response to the attacks, which only recently came to light after having gone on for months.
The Havana government has repeatedly denied any responsibility for the attacks, which also have affected the Canadian embassy in Havana.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said President Trump was “upset and passionate” about last week’s subway bombing in London when he tweeted shortly after the attack about a “loser terrorist” who had been “in the sights of Scotland Yard.”
Haley, in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” said the president had not intended to hinder British authorities in their response to the bombing by seemingly disclosing that an attacker or attackers had previously come to the attention of the Metropolitan Police.
“Look, the president would not want to do any harm to the investigation – let’s be clear,” Haley said. “There was no ill intent.”
Trump has previously tweeted out controversial statements about other terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom. He stirred indignation among many Londoners by attacking the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, after a June attack in London’s Borough Market that left seven dead.
Critics said Trump seized upon an attempt by Khan to calm the public about a stepped-up police deployment, using an out-of-context quote to imply that the mayor had said the attack – rather than the visible armed police presence in its aftermath – was no cause for alarm.
After a bombing in May at an Ariana Grande concert in the northern city of Manchester that left 22 people dead, British authorities were infuriated by a leak of important intelligence that had been shared by them with U.S. officials, as is customary between the two close allies.
Asked about Trump’s comments on the latest attack, British Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview that was pre-taped and aired separately on ABC, declined to directly criticize the president. But she said: “I don’t think it’s helpful for anyone to speculate on what it an ongoing investigation.”
The rush-hour bombing on Friday at the Parsons Green station and a subsequent stampede left 30 people injured, British officials said. The National Health Service said all but one of those hurt had been released from the hospital.
British officials said Sunday that a second man, age 21, had been arrested late Saturday in West London in connection with the attack, but provided few details. Earlier, an 18-year-old man was arrested at the port of Dover, from which ferries depart for continental Europe.  
In the latest instance of President Trump seeming to revel in the notion of physical attacks against perceived enemies, the president retweeted an animated GIF showing him hitting a golf ball that then knocks down his onetime rival Hillary Clinton.
Critics swiftly responded. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), appearing on ABC’s “This Week, said: “It’s distressing to have a president that frankly will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that.” 
The original tweet, from a user whose Twitter handle consists of an expletive, was sent last week and retweeted Sunday by the president, who is spending the weekend at his New Jersey golf property. Here is what he retweeted:
A former Trump campaign strategist, David Urban, brushed aside the controversy. “Retweets do not equal endorsements,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” leading to a sharp exchange.
The president has previously taken to Twitter to retweet animations including one that depicted him pummeling a figure with a CNN logo superimposed on his head. Another presidential Twitter share last month – later deleted – showed a train hitting a person, again with a CNN logo imposed on the figure’s head.
Trump associates have previously dismissed criticism of such retweets, suggesting they were intended to be humorous.
Clinton is out with a new book about the campaign, and Trump has repeatedly used Twitter to deride her as a sore loser.
In the first part of the animation Trump retweeted on Sunday, the president is seen in golf attire, teeing off. The second shows footage of Clinton tripping as she boards a plane, with the video altered to show her being struck in the back with a golf ball.
The tweet refers to “Donald Trump’s amazing golf swing” and uses the hashtag #CrookedHillary, the then-candidate’s most-used epithet for his Democratic opponent.

"Atlas shrugs, as do libertarians when it comes to working Americans","“Who is John Galt?” That is the mystery that drives Ayn Rand’s turgid libertarian manifesto, “Atlas Shrugged.” And it is the spirit of Galt that drives the modern Republican Party.
The fictional Galt is a brilliant, highly successful entrepreneur who leads a revolt of the underappreciated and overtaxed titans of industry. To pull the plug on an increasingly socialist society, Galt and his peers in the top 1% cease their own productive endeavors and bring the world economy to its knees.
In 2008, top-tier, real-life financiers did nearly bring the global economy crashing down, not by withholding their genius, but by using their cleverness to create a massive money-making machine for themselves built on a massive mortgage industry Ponzi scheme. We would have been in better shape if they had played hookie to play golf with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.
Nevertheless, the dogma that the world is divided between makers and takers underpins pretty much everything Congressional Republicans propose to do, from the schemes they have put forth to take away medical coverage from tens of millions of Americans to the proposed tax “reform” that is little more than a massive tax cut for the rich.
It does not take much scratching below the surface of high-minded Republican rhetoric about opportunity and freedom to uncover some very Galtish attitudes. To the libertarian-minded, the poor and working class people who are mired in economic stagnation have only themselves to blame. Any helping hand offered by government and paid for by taxes on the abundantly wealthy is a tyrannical expropriation that robs the rich and turns the undeserving recipients of aid into social parasites.
In the same way, any governmental restriction of an industrial enterprise for the sake of preserving a clean, healthy environment for the general good is an unjustified stab at the nation’s capitalist heart. Air thick with pollutants and waterways deadly enough to kill fish are the acceptable price to be paid to liberate the ambitions of the meritocracy.
And government action to protect consumers from dishonest business operations or workers from exploitation by employers is judged equally abhorrent by the protectors of those who claim to be savvier, more talented, more ambitious and more deserving of their outsized share of the nation’s abundance.

Donald Trump could become a two-term president. His path to re-election is not very hard to see.


Start with the fact that political math is not especially complex. In all but the most unusual presidential elections, there is little doubt about how 80% of the electorate will vote. Around 40% will...
The fallacies undergirding this world view are manifold. There are too many examples of incompetent CEOs, far too many revelations of corporate corruption and way too many instances of businesses cheating their customers to suggest that America’s many would-be Galts are uniformly men and women of superior intelligence and unquestionable virtue. For every genius innovator, such as Bill Gates or Elon Musk, there is a Trump who rides on his father’s success, careens in and out of bankruptcy and keeps his fortune intact by failing to pay contractors, bilking average folks who fall for his con jobs (Trump University) and making deals with unsavory foreigners and mobsters.
Yes, our economy needs the best kind of business people, from proprietors of small-town shops to executives at world-ranging corporations, and we would, indeed, be in trouble if they all suddenly stopped what they are doing. But we would also be in serious trouble if migrant workers stopped harvesting our food and if construction workers stopped building our roads and bridges and if engineers stopped designing our machines and if the legion of underpaid and underappreciated working people simply stayed home. And, if we allow an underclass to fester without healthcare and without access to quality education and without hope of a better life for their children, even the gated, walled communities of the rich will not be able to hold back the tide of social disintegration.
Who is John Galt? A selfish, short-sighted, arrogant jerk, not a model for America.

Facebook will provide ads bought by Russian company to congressional committees investigating Trump ties,"Responding to mounting pressure to reveal details about Russian-paid propaganda on its platform, Facebook said it would share more than 3,000 ads linked to Russia with congressional panels investigating foreign meddling in the 2016 election.
The move announced Thursday is a reversal for Facebook, which previously only showed staffers on Capitol Hill snippets of the ads before taking them back, citing user privacy. Facebook had given the ads and other information to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is also looking into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. But the company has been facing growing calls to assist congressional investigators after first publicly acknowledging on Sept. 6 that it had accepted at least $100,000 in Russia-linked ads.
“We believe it is vitally important that government authorities have the information they need to deliver to the public a full assessment of what happened in the 2016 election,” Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, said in a blog post Thursday.
Facebook cofounder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg discussed the disclosure during a live broadcast in which he also pledged to strengthen the company’s ad review process and instill more transparency in political advertising on his platform.
“I don't want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy. That's not what we stand for,” Zuckerberg said. “The integrity of our elections is fundamental to democracy around the world.”
Zuckerberg says he expects the government to publish findings about the Russian ads, which were aimed at exacerbating divisions on social issues like race, guns and immigration during the U.S. presidential campaign season.
The ads were purchased by 470 fake accounts traced back to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian firm known for using troll accounts to post on news sites.
Facebook executives briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month on the Russia-linked ads. But Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, and other lawmakers had criticized the company for refusing to turn over the materials that it had given to Mueller.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff of Burbank, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the Facebook material “should help us better understand what happened, beyond the preliminary briefings we already received.”
He added, “It will be important for the Committee to scrutinize how rigorous Facebook's internal investigation has been, to test its conclusions and to understand why it took as long as it did to discover the Russian sponsored advertisements and what else may yet be uncovered.”
Schiff made clear that Facebook is not the only company that investigators expect to hear from.
“As we continue our investigation to get to the bottom of Russia’s multifaceted attack on our democratic process,” he said, “I believe it will be necessary to hear directly from Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as others in the tech sector, including in open hearings that will inform the American public.”
No evidence has emerged publicly to indicate there was coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
But the use of social media was part of a broad effort by the Kremlin to influence the presidential election, U.S. intelligence agencies said in a January report. It concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the campaign to help Trump and damage his opponent, Hillary Clinton.
The intelligence report found that Russian social media users had posted messages hostile to Clinton. But the impact of the Facebook ads on the election remains unclear, current and former officials said.
“The Russians have long considered information operations like this to be part of their foreign policy toolbox,” said J. Michael Daniel, a former senior cyber-security official in the Obama administration. “But they’re not necessarily seeking to elect an individual; they’re seeking to sow division to sow distrust.”
Most of the ads, which ran between June of 2015 and May of 2017, were bought online, without any contact between Facebook and the buyers, Zuckerberg said. The buys totaled about $100,000, and only a quarter were geographically targeted to the U.S.
Facebook’s move comes at a time when lawmakers and the public are debating whether it’s necessary to rein in the growing power and influence of America’s largest technology companies.
“Governments have lost patience with platforms that look more like enablers than innovators to regulators these days, which suggests more regulation on the horizon,” said Albert Gidari of the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School.
Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, have a combined market capitalization of $3 trillion and an even greater market dominance over consumer data. Facebook’s and Google’s chokehold on information is cited as one of the reasons the so-called fake news phenomenon was able to fester.
Unlike newspapers and TV networks, which must disclose how much they charge for political ads as well as who paid for them, platforms like Facebook and Twitter don’t have to share data and aren’t liable for what their users post online.
That’s thanks to two federal laws that were introduced years before anyone knew what a like, share or a tweet was. The first, the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act, restricts government access to private digital communications. The other, Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, absolves Internet companies from most things its users do on their platforms.
However, a bill introduced in the Senate in August, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, is seen as a proxy battle to undo some of the protections tech companies enjoy under Section 230. The law, which would target sex trafficking online, could set a precedent for expanding criminal liability among the platforms.
Tech companies have been quietly resisting the bill, but Facebook’s decision to make concessions Thursday may suggest a willingness to go beyond what the law requires to placate its critics.
The company has faced backlash from observers who say it’s unfair that Facebook doesn’t have to play by the same rules as traditional publishers.
Zuckerberg said ad buyers will now have to disclose who they are and provide other ads they’re sharing to audiences on Facebook.
He said the company was continuing to investigate “what happened on Facebook” during the election, looking at other “foreign actors,” including “other Russian groups.”
“We may find more, and if we do, we will continue to work with the government,” he said.
But Facebook executives are also nervous that the company’s cooperation with the government could lead to a backlash, either from users who want the site to remain free from government intrusion or from pro-Russian hackers.
“I'm not going to sit here and tell you we're going to catch all bad content in our system,” Zuckerberg said. “We don't check what people say before they say it, and frankly, I don't think our society should want us to.”

"Trump announces new sanctions against North Korea, but China's role remains key","President Trump announced Thursday a new round of sanctions against North Korea as he struggles to confront that country’s determination to build a nuclear arsenal.
After threatening earlier this week to “totally destroy” North Korea if it uses its nuclear weaponry against U.S. territory or allies, Trump told reporters he was issuing a new executive order, adding more sanctions to those that the United States and allies already have imposed.
He said the measures would target North Korea's textiles, fishing industry and shipping. Sanctions against those industries are already in place, so it was not clear what was different about the additional ones.
“The brutal North Korean regime does not respect its own citizens or the sovereignty of other nations,” Trump said. “Our new executive order will cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea's efforts to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind.’
Under the executive order, the U.S. Treasury Department will be able to blacklist any businesses and individuals trading or doing financial work with North Korea.
That could force other nations and foreign businesses to make a choice: ""Do business with the United States ... or the lawless regime"" of North Korea,” Trump said.
He repeated that he wants nothing less than “a complete denuclearization of North Korea.” Many observers call that standard all but impossible, given Pyongyang's progress to date.
Trump, on the margins of the annual United Nations General Assembly, also met Thursday with the presidents of Japan and South Korea, the two neighbors of North Korea with the most at stake in the showdown.
Japan’s President Shinzo Abe praised Trump’s willingness to push North Korea to the negotiating table, adding that “dialogue for the sake of dialogue would not produce anything.” Abe, who spent a weekend at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in February, repeatedly referred to Trump as “Donald.”
“The key at this moment is to exercise and apply pressure against North Korea in a robust manner,” Abe said. “And together with Donald we have been successfully demonstrating our strong will to exercise pressure against North Korea.”
Trump, asked by a reporter if diplomatic talks with North Korea were still possible, said, “Why not?”
South Korean President Moon Jae-in also voiced concerns about North Korea’s behavior but he, too, has advocated diplomacy and dialogue, not the military option that Trump at times suggests he is considering. Most experts think a military response to North Korea could lead to catastrophic violence against the southern half of the peninsula, where thousands of American troops are stationed.
“North Korea has continued to make provocations, and this is extremely deplorable and this has angered both me and our people,” Moon said, adding he was grateful for the United States’ firm response.
Trump took the opportunity to reiterate his opposition to the U.S. trade deal with South Korea, which he said favored Seoul. Experts have said it is the wrong time to call the deal into question given tensions with North Korea.
“But our real focus will be on the military and our relationship with South Korea, which is excellent,” Trump said.
Thus far, sanctions have failed to deter North Korea. The regime launched two missiles within two months, and completed an underground test of what was thought to be a hydrogen bomb, its most powerful yet. In all, the country has conducted six nuclear tests.
It has threatened Japan, South Korea and the U.S. territory of Guam, as well as the continental U.S. Trump has responded with equally bellicose language, threatening to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea.
Kim also fired two mid-range missiles over one of Japan’s northern islands, both landing in the ocean
Few diplomats or arms control experts foresee Kim abandoning his nuclear arsenal — now estimated to include 20 to 60 bombs. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has called on the country to stop testing ballistic missiles as a confidence-building measure to allow diplomacy to proceed.
But Kim has shown no interest in such talks. Responding late Thursday to Trump, Kim said the American president was “deranged,” a ""rogue"" and a ""gangster"" who would ""pay dearly"" for his insults to North Korea, according to the North Korean state news agency.
Earlier this week, Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a “suicide mission.”
The Trump administration succeeded in securing unanimous approval at the U.N. Security Council for sanctions against North Korea in August and again in September that target more than a third of the country’s income.
Mnuchin said the sanctions that Trump authorized Thursday were stronger because they would target any transaction with North Korea and anyone who facilitated such transaction.
“The objective is for them to give up their ballistic weapons,” he said, adding he had no timeline for when China’s banking measures might have an impact.
And he defended sanctions against criticism that they have been ineffective. Many countries, especially Russia and China and some African nations, have found ways around them.
“I don’t think other sanctions have failed,” Mnuchin said.
Many experts agree that sanctions are a better path than military action.
“New Trump administration sanctions against North Korea a smart move, raising cost to Pyongyang for its nuke programs,” tweeted Nicholas Burns, a former State Department official in Democratic and Republic administrations and frequent critic of Trump.
Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who is also often critical of the administration, said: “The United States is an economic and military superpower, and trade is an effective weapon.”
Potentially significant was Trump’s claim that China had agreed to restrict North Korea’s access to its banking system. China is North Korea’s chief ally and responsible for 90% of its trade. The Trump administration has repeatedly sought Beijing’s cooperation in enforcing sanctions, but China is nervous about causing the government in North Korea to collapse because it might trigger a refugee crisis or broader instability.
However, there were questions about whether China had actually agreed to what Trump suggested, and the White House would not go into detail.
""Secretary [Steven] Mnuchin [of Treasury] and People’s Bank of China [Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan] had a productive meeting this morning,"" said White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah.
China has previously agreed to enforce sanctions against North Korea, only to later pull back.
Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert in the Obama administration, said the new measures represented a ""fairly sizable escalation"" in pressure against North Korea. But he said the key will be if the U.S. begins using the new powers to sanction Chinese banks that deal with North Korea.
""This is, in my view, the potential start of a process that could go slowly or swiftly, but it is certain that no decision has been made yet whether to actually hit [the] Chinese bank,"" Nephew said. ""There is a general authority here to sanction exporters and importers, which is probably more likely to be used first than the finance thing [against banks.]”
Already, the U.S. and the U.N. have imposed tough economic sanctions against North Korea that eat away at its export income, imports and revenue from workers it sends overseas. But none of those measures has curbed efforts by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to develop intercontinental missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the United States.

"Republicans' new repeal bill would probably leave millions more uninsured, new analyses suggest","The latest Republican bid to roll back the Affordable Care Act would likely leave millions of currently insured Americans without health coverage in the coming decades, and strip benefits and protections from millions more, a growing number of independent studies suggest.
Healthcare safety nets in dozens of states stand to lose more than $200 billion by 2026 and hundreds of billions of dollars more in the years that follow, the analyses indicate.
And while the magnitude of the coverage losses is difficult to quantify because the new GOP proposal — written by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) — leaves crucial details to be determined, studies of similar proposals suggest tens of millions of Americans would see major changes to their health coverage.
“The vast majority of states lose money, and some lose truly jaw-dropping amounts,” said Jocelyn Guyer, managing director of Manatt Health, a consulting firm that has analyzed the Graham-Cassidy proposal.
“That suggests coverage losses that are likely somewhere between significant and vast,” she said.
Analyses by other experts — including consultant Avalere Health, the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank — reach similar conclusions, suggesting the bill would likely erode the historic insurance gains recorded in recent years.
Since 2014, when the current health law was fully enacted, more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans have gained coverage, driving the rate of uninsured to the lowest levels ever recorded.
Fitch Ratings added its own caution, warning in a report that states would face significant “budgetary challenges” under the GOP proposal, which, in turn, could put pressure on state support for schools, cities and colleges and universities.
States like California that have moved aggressively to expand coverage through the 2010 law by expanding Medicaid eligibility and investing in a robust insurance marketplace stand to lose the most under Graham-Cassidy, Avalere and others suggest.
GOP leaders have issued repeated assurances in recent days that the Graham-Cassidy bill would not erode protections extended by the 2010 law, often called Obamacare.
“More people will have coverage, and we protect those with preexisting conditions,” Cassidy said Wednesday in an interview with CNN.
But as they rush to vote, Republican lawmakers are not waiting for an independent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, which lawmakers customarily rely on to asses the impact of large, complex bills. A spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Politico on Wednesday that McConnell is planning a vote next week.
President Trump added his encouragement from New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly.
“They’re going to do a great job,” the president told reporters, noting many GOP lawmakers had been embarrassed by their inability to pass a repeal bill. “If this happens, it will be a great thing for the country.”
CBO analyses of previous GOP repeal plans have estimated coverage losses of 20 million or more.
And Republicans’ claims about the current bill are contradicted by virtually every independent analysis, as well as assessments by leading patient advocates, hospital groups, insurers and physicians.
No major group representing patients or people who work in the healthcare system backs the Graham-Cassidy proposal.
Even health insurers that have largely remained quiet in this year’s repeal debate publicly criticized the GOP plan Wednesday.
The Blue Cross Blue Shield Assn. cautioned the plan would likely destabilize insurance markets, “making coverage more expensive and jeopardizing Americans’ choice of health plans.”
Also joining opposition to the bill Wednesday was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who warned that Graham-Cassidy would hurt residents of his state.
Christie, who heads the president’s opioid commission, was the seventh GOP governor to publicly oppose the proposal. Fifteen Republican governors sent a letter this week backing Graham-Cassidy.
Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel jumped into the debate as well, deriding Cassidy in his monologue Tuesday for going back on a promise he made to Kimmel earlier this year that he would not back any plan that didn’t protect sick Americans.
""This guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face,"" said Kimmel, who earlier this year recounted his newborn son's congenital heart condition in an emotional discussion about the importance of robust insurance protections.
Previous studies by the Congressional Budget Office have concluded that proposals like Graham-Cassidy, which gives states authority to waive insurance protections and allow insurers to charge sick consumers more, would result in substantial coverage losses.
The centerpiece of the GOP bill is a new system for distributing hundreds of billions of dollars of federal money that would restructure how the government provides healthcare assistance to some 80 million Americans.
That would represent the nation’s largest change in the way healthcare is financed in more than half a century.
The bill would effectively end both the current Medicaid program, which covers poor Americans, and the system of insurance subsidies made available by the 2010 healthcare law to help low- and moderate-income consumers buy health plans.
In place of these programs, the federal government would give states blocks of money to redesign their healthcare safety net, while also capping future federal support for states.
The expanded flexibility would allow states to create better programs that cost less, Graham and Cassidy have said.
But any benefits from more flexibility would likely be outweighed by the very large reductions in aid, said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, which calculated that Graham-Cassidy would reduce federal funding to states by $215 billion over the next decade.
“This is a substantial cut to Medicaid funding and no one should be unclear about that,” he said. “There would undoubtedly be major coverage losses in places like California, where the state would not be able to support continued coverage expansion.”
Other blue states that have traditionally offered strong healthcare safety nets also stand to lose billions. So, too, do a number of red states that have expanded coverage through the 2010 law, including Arkansas, Arizona, Kentucky, Louisiana and Ohio.
States that have not expanded coverage stand to gain money in the short term because of a formula in Graham-Cassidy that effectively reallocates money between states.
But over the long term, all states will see cuts, Fitch and other analysts noted.
That is true particularly after 2026, when Congress would have to find more than $1 trillion to continue federal healthcare aid to states.
“There is no guarantee of whether and at what level federal funding would be available beginning in 2027,” Manatt Health notes in its analysis.
Times staff writer Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.

Manafort offered ‘private briefings’ with Russian billionaire during Trump’s presidential campaign,"Donald Trump's former campaign chairman offered to provide briefings on the 2016 race to a Russian billionaire closely aligned with the Kremlin. (Sept. 20, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR)


Donald Trump's former campaign chairman offered to provide briefings on the 2016 race to a Russian billionaire closely aligned with the Kremlin. (Sept. 20, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR)
In the middle of Donald Trump's presidential run, then-campaign Chairman Paul Manafort said he was willing to provide ""private briefings"" about the campaign to a Russian billionaire the U.S. government considers close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Manafort's offer was memorialized in an email exchange with a former employee of his political consulting firm in July 2016. It was first reported by the Washington Post, which said portions of Manafort's emails were read to reporters.
Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni confirmed to the Associated Press that the email exchanges were legitimate but said no briefings ever occurred. The email involved an offer for Oleg Deripaska, a wealthy Russian who made his money in the aluminum business.
The July 7, 2016, email came a little over a week before the Republican National Convention, while Manafort was leading the Trump campaign's day-to-day operations. It also occurred about a month after Manafort attended a meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York. That meeting was brokered by Donald Trump Jr., who was told in emails that the meeting was part of a Russian government effort to help his father's campaign.
The Manafort email exchange regarding Deripaska is one of thousands of pages of material turned over to congressional committees by the Trump campaign. It is also in the possession of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating whether there was any coordination between Trump associates and Russians looking to interfere in the presidential campaign. Mueller is also examining Manafort's taxes and his foreign banking as part of an investigation related to his consulting work in Ukraine.


Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has sought a variety of documents related to President Trump’s tenure in the White House, the president’s attorney, John Dowd, has confirmed.


The inquiry from Mueller, the former FBI director who is heading the investigation of Russian election meddling and...
Manafort has denied any wrongdoing, saying his work in Ukraine was open and appropriate. He has also denied involvement in any efforts to undermine the U.S. election on behalf of Russia. Deripaska has denied any involvement with the Trump campaign and said he is willing to testify before congressional committees investigating Russian election interference to defend his reputation and his name.
According to the Post, Manafort wrote the email to a former employee, Konstantin Kilimnik, who had worked for years with him on political consulting in Ukraine. Manafort asked Kilimnik to pass the offer to Deripaska.
""If he needs private briefings we can accommodate,"" Manafort wrote — referring to Deripaska — in the email, according to the Post.
In a statement, Maloni dismissed the correspondence as ""innocuous."" He said the exchange was part of an effort on Manafort's part to collect money from clients who owed him money. The Post reported that several email exchanges between Manafort and Kilimnik discussed money that Manafort said he was owed by former clients in Eastern Europe.
""It is no secret Mr. Manafort was owed money by past clients after his work ended in 2014,"" Maloni said in the statement.
The email is the first to indicate that Manafort was attempting to reach Deripaska while he was working on the Trump campaign, but it's unclear whether the offer ever reached Deripaska or his representatives. The Post reported that, according to documents detailed to its reporters, there was no evidence Deripaska received the offer.
Attorneys for Deripaska in New York and Washington did not respond to phone messages or emails Wednesday evening. Kilimnik did not immediately respond to an email Wednesday evening. A phone number previously used by him was not accepting calls.
The Post quoted Vera Kurochkina, a spokeswoman for one of Deripaska's companies, who said inquiries about the emails ""veer into manufactured questions so grossly false and insinuating that I am concerned even responding to these fake connotations provides them the patina of reality."" She also dismissed the email exchanges, the Post said, as scheming by ""consultants in the notorious 'Beltway bandit' industry.""
The Associated Press reported in March that before signing with Trump's campaign, Manafort secretly worked for Deripaska and proposed plans for political consulting work in Eastern Europe that he said could ""greatly benefit the Putin Government.""
In a 2005 memo to Deripaska, Manafort laid out the details of the proposal that were subsequently spelled out the following year as part of a $10-million contract, according to interviews with people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. It's unclear how much of the work was carried out. The AP previously reported that Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009. The two later had a falling-out, laid bare in 2014 in a Cayman Islands court.
The AP cited U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 describing Deripaska as ""among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis"" and ""a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin's trips abroad."" Deripaska has also sworn in a New York state court document that he has been granted ""a diplomatic passport from Russia, and on occasion I have represented the government in countries outside Russia.""
Deripaska sued the AP for defamation over the story in May in U.S. District Court in Washington, alleging the story was inaccurate and hurt his career by falsely accusing him of criminal activity. Deripaska's lawyers complained to the AP at the time that the article ""suggests that Mr. Deripaska has been involved with Mr. Manafort more recently,"" and the lawsuit said, ""Mr. Deripaska severed relations with Mr. Manafort many years ago."" The AP has said it stands by the accuracy of its story, and has asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit.
Manafort has previously said he worked for Deripaska to advance his business interests but denied his work was meant to advance Russia's interests.
The Post reported that Kilimnik and Manafort at times referred to Deripaska as ""OVD"" in the emails. That shorthand is consistent with how Manafort and other employees at his former consulting business referred to the billionaire in other documents obtained by the AP, including the 2005 proposal that referred to a plan to ""greatly benefit the Putin Government.""
According to other emails obtained by the AP that are in the hands of Mueller and congressional committees, Manafort had previously shut down efforts to have Trump meet with Russians during the campaign.
In mid-May 2016, a Trump campaign aide wrote to Manafort that ""Russia has been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite some time,"" noting that representatives from the country had been reaching out to him.
Manafort responded to his deputy, Rick Gates, that the meetings were a nonstarter. ""We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips,"" he wrote, referring to Trump. The two decided that the communication should come from a person in the campaign who responds to ""all mail of non-importance"" so as not to send a message.

"After months of challenges and controversy, Trump's travel ban expires Sunday — and a new one may be coming","Days before the expiration of President Trump’s much-contested travel ban, the White House is reviewing a security report that aides say could serve as the basis of a new, and perhaps broader, version.
The classified report by the Department of Homeland Security, sent to the White House last week, is a study of the available security and intelligence information in countries worldwide, not just the six Muslim-majority nations subject to Trump’s order banning travel by their citizens to the United States. That order expires on Sunday.
Based on the findings, Trump could decide to keep the travel ban in place, or either limit or expand it, possibly before Sunday.
The order also stopped all refugee resettlement in the U.S. for 120 days, so that ban would continue in effect for roughly a month more. The Supreme Court in June had allowed the refugee ban to take effect, with exceptions for refugees who could show a “bona fide” connection to the U.S., along with a revised travel ban for 90 days in the six specified nations.
David Lapan, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said it was “certainly possible” that more countries could come under travel restrictions.
“It’s about the conditions in the countries and the quality of information, and not the political or religious factors,” he said.
“You have Muslim-majority countries that are in civil war, you have Muslim-majority countries that have major terrorism problems,” Lapan said. “You could have countries that were not majority-Muslim that would have the same problems.”
The White House declined to comment, but Trump, writing on Twitter after the London train explosion last week, made it clear that he would like to put in place even broader travel restrictions.
“The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific — but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!” he tweeted.
White House national security advisor H.R. McMaster on Sunday said a new travel ban would be a “first step in better screening” of who is trying to enter the country.
“This is something that we’re looking at — how to protect the American people better,” he said on ABC’s ”This Week.”
The security report provides an opening for the administration to try once again to reset its case for the ban, which has been under sustained attack in the federal courts ever since its helter-skelter rollout in the early days of Trump’s presidency.
On Jan. 27, a week after taking office, Trump signed an order banning entry to the U.S. from citizens of seven nations initially — Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Iraq. Issued with scant notice to security agencies, the ban created confusion and protests at airports across the country before federal judges signed orders blocking its implementation.
On March 6, Trump signed a new order that dropped Iraq from the list but kept the ban in place for 90 days for the other six countries. The order instructed Homeland Security to conduct a “worldwide review” of security conditions to determine whether the U.S. could be confident that it could identify which travelers could pose a threat.
The Supreme Court allowed the order to take effect on June 26; the 90-day clock runs out on Sunday.
Lapan said it’s unlikely that countries such as Syria would drop off the list. “It’s hard to say that would happen because conditions in those countries wouldn’t change that much,” he said.
Trump himself has added to his administration’s challenges in defending the ban, starting with his call during last year’s campaign for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.” That allowed lawyers who opposed the measures to argue that they amounted to unconstitutional religious discrimination against Muslims.
Even after the ban was rewritten, and the president’s senior officials were telling reporters that the word “ban” was not accurate, Trump went on Twitter to insist it was a ban. He criticized the federal courts as well as his own Justice Department.
“The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version,” he tweeted.
The Supreme Court is scheduled to take up the ban on Oct. 10, but that case might be moot if the administration replaces the order with a third version.

Mueller seeks documents related to Trump’s actions while in White House,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has sought documents related to President Trump's actions while in the White House. (Sept. 21, 2017)


Special Counsel Robert Mueller has sought documents related to President Trump's actions while in the White House. (Sept. 21, 2017)
Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has sought a variety of documents related to President Trump’s tenure in the White House, the president’s attorney, John Dowd, has confirmed.
The inquiry from Mueller, the former FBI director who is heading the investigation of Russian election meddling and activities of Trump, his campaign and associates, suggests the investigation could be broadening and reaching a new phase. Dowd, however, said in an interview that the requests were routine and being handled without incident.
“There’s nothing remarkable or unusual about his requests and Ty is responding to them in due course,” Dowd said, referring to Ty Cobb, another attorney hired by Trump to deal with the special counsel investigation.
“It’s not like something’s about to happen,” Dowd said. “It’s just a routine inquiry by Bob.”
The document requests were first reported on Wednesday by the New York Times, which said Mueller had asked for materials related to 13 areas, including an Oval Office meeting Trump had with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in May — one day after firing James B. Comey as FBI director. In that meeting, Trump reportedly told Lavrov and Russia’s then-ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, that firing Comey had relieved “great pressure” on Trump related to the Russia investigation.
Mueller also reportedly has asked for records relating to the White House response to questions about a meeting last year in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. and several Russians. Emails revealed that Trump Jr. was told before the meeting that the Russian government had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
The Times also reported that Mueller is seeking documents related to Trump’s ouster of Michael Flynn as his national security advisor. Flynn’s contacts with Russians are also part of the investigation.
Dowd said the White House is cooperating with Mueller completely.
“We have said for now two months that we will cooperate with Bob,” Dowd said. “He makes requests. We respond to them and we have a very good relationship with him and I don’t think it would be right for me to describe the contents.”
Mueller, appointed as special counsel in May, has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. It also includes an examination into Trump’s firing of Comey.
The investigation seems to be aggressive; FBI agents in July raided the home of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager.
Trump has expressed frustration with the investigation and warned in an interview with the New York Times in July that Mueller would be crossing a red line if the probe delved into his finances.
A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.

NBC hopes the ratings will rise and shine on 'Megyn Kelly Today',"Megyn Kelly is shown shaking hands and hugging regular folks in the promotional spots for her new NBC morning show that debuts Monday. She looks like a candidate running for office, and in a way, she is.
Kelly was part of a politically charged atmosphere during her 12 years at Fox News, surrounded by conservative commentators on the network’s prime-time schedule. By moving across the street to NBC, she wants to leave behind the often bitter partisan debate that is driving cable news ratings up to record levels in the age of President Trump.
But she will have to convince viewers that she can make the transformation from steely, sharp-elbowed, provocative anchor to the kind of warm, familiar companion that viewers want in a morning TV host. NBC is counting on it after poaching Kelly from Fox for $18 million a year and rebuilding the third hour of its franchise morning program “Today” around her. The 9 a.m. hour is being renamed “Megyn Kelly Today.”
The pressure on Kelly to succeed is heightened by the lackluster ratings performance of her prime-time magazine program “Sunday Night,” which is scheduled to return sometime next year.
But Kelly isn’t worried. 
“I have a nice long runway,” said Kelly, 46, in an interview from her fifth-floor office at NBC’s New York headquarters that overlooks Rockefeller Plaza. “No one is expecting me to fly the plane perfectly and at 30,000 feet as soon as they turn the engine on. That takes some of the pressure off and allows me and my team to focus on content.”
Kelly could have stayed at Fox News, where she became a major star after 25 million people saw her take on President Trump during the first Republican primary debate in 2015. But while the exchange heightened her fame, it thrust her into the current polarizing environment and made her one of then-candidate Trump’s first targets on Twitter.
“Just because you’re good at something doesn’t mean it makes you happy,” Kelly said. “I’ve wanted to do something that was more inspirational.”
“Megyn Kelly Today” is going to air live in front of a studio audience each day. She will interview celebrity guests and not-so-famous people with uplifting stories, hoping to make viewers feel more “empowered” in their lives, she said. Segments on parenting, relationships, health, diet and finance will be part of the mix.
The program will also take a news topic of the day and discuss it more in depth. Not every story will involve Trump.
“That’s a mistake too many broadcasters are making right now,” Kelly said. “They make everything all about him. Those who support him and those who don’t -- I’ve had it up to here with that.”
Page Hurwitz, a veteran talk show producer who oversaw Rosie O’Donnell’s daytime program, believes NBC will have to find the right balance between news and lighter fare for Kelly.
“We haven’t seen anyone whose background is exclusively journalism make a real go of it in daytime talk,” Hurwitz said. “It seems like the audience wants to be entertained rather than strictly informed. But everyone knows she’s coming from news so that’s really her lane.”
Still, NBC’s commitment to Kelly is apparent in the show’s title, which combines her name with the morning franchise. She is even getting a version of the signature “Today” sunrise as part of the logo for her stand-alone hour.
Throughout the summer, NBC has worked at warming up Kelly’s hard-edged news image beyond the promotional campaign. “Today” ran a segment that followed her family on a camping trip. The show has also offered up daily tidbits about her personality such as her go-to karaoke song (Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain), No. 1 pet peeve (making weekend plans before noon on a weekend) and favorite ice cream flavor (campfire s’mores). During a guest spot this week on “Ellen,” she danced in the audience while wearing an inflatable sumo suit.
Jackie Levin, a veteran “Today” producer who is overseeing Kelly’s hour, believes the host has the authenticity the morning audience demands.
“She is a real person,” said Levin, who did not know Kelly before being named as producer of the show. “She is a total natural at this. She is quick on her feet and really funny. I just hope people give her a fair shake.”
She should find her new time period more hospitable than prime-time because the “Today” 7 to 9 a.m. anchors Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie will be leading into her hour and providing promotion throughout the morning.
While “Today” has been losing viewers to cable news networks this year, it’s still the top-rated morning program in the 25-to-54 age group advertisers covet and is nipping at the heels of ABC’s “Good Morning America” in viewers overall.
The 9 a.m. hour “Today” had an average audience of 2.7 million viewers during the 2016-17 TV season with Al Roker, Dylan Dreyer and Sheinelle Jones as co-hosts, down 12% from the prior season. They will still be seen on the 7 to 9 a.m. edition of the program. In most markets, “the third hour” as it’s called, faces Disney/ABC’s syndicated program “Live! With Kelly and Ryan,” hosted by Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, which has 3.2 million viewers and is down 20%.
Standard Media Index puts 2017 ad spending on NBC’s 9 a.m. hour at $53.8 million through August, down 2.5% from a year earlier.
“The question is whether Megyn Kelly will pull new viewers to the time slot and maybe she can,” Hurwitz said.
Another question is whether African American TV viewers, who make up 18% of the available audience in the 9 a.m. hour, will embrace Kelly.
Kelly’s appeal with that segment will be tested because she faced criticism by liberal media watchdog groups in 2016 over tussles she had on Fox News with leaders and supporters of the Black Lives Matter protests against police killings of African Americans.
“Our show was extremely fair and that’s why we got a guest like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who would not go on the rest of the channel,” she said. “What I stood up for when I was at Fox was keeping an open mind.”
Pepper Miller, a Chicago-based market research consultant, does not believe any negative feeling those viewers have towards Fox News will follow her to NBC.
“If Megyn Kelly can be a real authentic journalist who seeks the truth for the viewing audience she will be fine,” Miller said.
Kelly won’t steer from serious topics. Her first week will have a segment featuring four female black police chiefs from North Carolina discussing race relations and law enforcement.
“To this day some of these women will go into a department store and be followed because of the color of the skin,” said Kelly. “And we get into all of it.”

"2017 Lamborghini Aventador S: How does 145 mph feel in a $483,000 car?","It wasn’t until I hit 145 mph that I thought, “This could be dangerous.”
By then, I was leaving the straightaway and entering the high-banked left turn, pressed hard into the seat of the Lamborghini Aventador S as I roared my way around the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana.
A buck and a half, on that track, in that car, wasn’t fast. A pro driver behind the wheel of the Aventador could have hit 200 mph without stretching the Lamborghini’s limits. Other drivers that day hit 160.
But I’d never driven a super car on a racetrack. Besides, I’d just noticed the “air bag” icon was illuminated on the dashboard.
I had come to Fontana at the invitation of the Lamborghini people. The half-day event included a chalk-talk on the Aventador S’s attributes, a coach-led turn around a short track, a “slow slalom” and then a “fast slalom” exercise, and then a few hot laps around the Auto Club Speedway’s “Sports Car Course.”
Lamborghini calls the Aventador S a “super sports car,” and I won’t quibble. Driven by a rumbling V-12 engine that makes 740 horsepower and 508 pound-feet of torque, the sleek, reptilian coupe is said to be capable of rocketing from zero to 60 mph in less than 2.9 seconds and of hitting a top speed of 217 mph.
The 2017 S version makes 40 more horsepower than the Aventador that Lamborghini debuted in 2011. It also is the first Lamborghini production car to combine four-wheel drive and rear-wheel steering.
Together these attributes create a drive feel that is responsive and very sticky. In the slow slalom sections, the car’s turning radius felt tiny, like it would be capable of navigating a supermarket parking lot and, maybe, even the aisles inside the supermarket.
On the fast slalom section, I couldn’t get the back end to bust loose no matter how sharply I turned or how hard I was accelerating. The car remained stable and planted up to and including the mandatory brake-slam stop at the end of the slalom.
The naturally aspirated Aventador S manages its power through a seven-speed automatic gear box and four drive modes. Strada (or “Street”) is for that supermarket run. Sport engages more engine and more engine sound, and sharpens the steering and suspension.
Corsa (or “Course”) unleashes everything, for the track, and requires manual gear selection through the paddle shifters. The “Ego” mode allows the driver to make specific individual selection in power, steering, suspension and other details.
For looks, Lamborghini designers were reaching back to the company’s Countach and Diablo cars of the past, giving the new Aventador’s body a bit of shark and its nose a bit of snake. (Like the Miura, Huracan and other Lambos, the Aventador is named for a famed four-legged hero of the bullfighting ring.)
For feel, Lamborghini’s engineers went a little bit old school. There’s no turbo here, and there’s no dual clutch transmission — standard on most performance cars.
Instead, this Aventador has a single clutch transmission. That gear box, with so much horsepower and torque, creates an extremely engaged driver experience. The car hurtles forward under hard acceleration and leaps through the gears with neck-snapping force.
Lamborghini may be making a virtue of a necessity with the gear box. Having opted not to use the dual clutch transmission, which has gotten high marks as part of the Huracan power train, the company has taken some criticism for using such old-fashioned technology in its flagship sports car.
Its visceral feel became more evident to me when, following the driving coach, I put on a racing helmet, belted myself in, and began running the short part of the sports car course.
The Aventador S shot violently from corner to corner, eating up asphalt and holding tight lines through the turns. I couldn’t force the car to lose traction, it seemed, even under the heaviest acceleration, downshifting or braking. The only limitations were my own.
Lamborghini is advertising the Aventador S as a daily driver that can perform on the track. The designers have given the car some user-friendly qualities.
The airplane-like cockpit, tucked inside an all-carbon-fiber monocoque shell, brings everything within easy reach of the pilot. Standard and optional amenities include Apple CarPlay, heated seats and a very good HVAC system. The interior can be dressed in carbon fiber or Alcantara leather, and the seats and steering wheel can be customized with bespoke upholstery and contrast stitching.
Provided you’re limber enough to swing through the dihedral doors, then angle down and into the snug, low-slung race seats, and also limber enough to get back out, this could be your daily driver.
There are limitations. The eight-gallon gas tank will take you barely 100 miles of driving, thanks to the shockingly low fuel economy. And overnighting, in addition to frequent gas stops, would require savvy packing, since the front end “trunk” will hardly hold more than your toothbrush.
Daily driving would also mean growing comfortable with the tight steering, the stiff suspension, and the neighbor-waking roar of the V-12 engine. It would also mean exercising restraint, or risk filling that small glove compartment with speeding citations.
My concern on the track was getting a citation for going too slow. As we left the small course and headed onto the NASCAR straightaway used by the stock cars, sports cars and sprint cars, I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to keep up with my more seasoned fellow drivers.
Down the first stretch, approaching the big left hand bank turn, I saw the speedometer climb from 125 mph to 135 mph before I put my eyes back on the track.
The other drivers weren’t racing away from me, but on the second lap we were all faster. Down the straightaway I caught 145 mph, and was still accelerating, before chopping the throttle and swooshing through the big turn.
I never did find out why the air bag icon was illuminated.
Lamborghini is not a volume player. Though the Aventador is reportedly the best-selling V-12 car in history, last year the company sold only 3,457 vehicles globally.
Those numbers will no doubt go up when Lambo begins selling its Urus SUV, some time next year.
For now, the company is looking for a few good drivers ready to pony up a base price well above $400,000.
They're getting ready to entertain a few more who insist on driving 217 miles per hour with the top down. Last week Lamborghini unveiled the Aventador S Roadster at the Frankfurt auto show. That one starts at a reported $460,247.

",
The risk-taker pushing Intel into the new world of artificial intelligence,"To get a sense of computer scientist Naveen Rao, just take a look at his hands.
The 42-year-old has busted all 10 of his fingers over a lifetime of skiing, skateboarding, bicycling, rollerblading, race-car driving, wrestling and hoops.
He’s not a clod; he’s a risk taker who pushes physical and mental boundaries. On the mental side, he’s trying to quicken the computer industry’s move into a new age of artificial intelligence by creating chips and software inspired by the structure of behavior of the computer brain.
What sets Rao apart from others attempting the same thing is the fact that Intel last year bought his San Diego company, Nervana, for $400 million.
That’s some stamp of approval. Intel is a computer-chip industry giant, with sales topping $60 billion a year. But it’s an aging giant. Intel turns 50 next year, and everyone agrees it requires some revitalization, having infamously missed the industry’s massive shift to mobile computing.
Now Intel is trying to catch the industry’s next rising wave: artificial intelligence, or, more precisely, a subset of AI known as deep learning.
Cars that drive themselves, personal devices that converse with their owners and carry out tasks, social media features that can identify your friends in group photographs — all are made possible by deep learning. So are computers that can diagnose CAT-scan images on their own or pick stocks for hedge fund managers.
Snap a picture of a road sign in Spain and your phone translates it into English. That app is based on deep learning. Recommendations just for you on Netflix and Spotify? Deep learning plays a role in those features, too.
“We can now solve problems that we couldn’t solve before,” said Peter Norvig, director of research at Google and a key figure in the history of AI.
Deep learning is a new, more marketing-friendly term for a concept that’s been around for decades, known as neural networks. Rather than run calculations in serial fashion, like traditional computers, neural networks mimic the behavior of nerve clusters in the human brain — firing signals and stifling them, arranging data into patterns roughly analogous to human memory.
Why is deep learning suddenly on the rise? The enormous amount of data being created around the world from sensors mounted in everything from smartphones to drones to surveillance cameras and more, matched with ever more powerful chips and other computer hardware, make it possible.
As a result, the computer industry is changing “faster than Intel or anyone else expected it to,” said Mario Morales, semiconductor analyst at IDC. Experts say artificial intelligence is now a major growth business that will rake in billions of dollars for companies that provide the best hardware and software.
That’s where Rao comes in. His job is to help Intel move beyond the central processing unit, or CPU — the product that’s ruled the semiconductor industry for several decades. The CPU is at the heart of every desktop and laptop computer built since the start of the personal computer revolution in the 1970s. Two companies dominated that field: Microsoft, with its operating system software, and Intel, with its “Intel Inside” central processors.
Deep learning software runs on CPUs, but inefficiently. CPUs are inherently general purpose devices. Maximum computing power required for deep learning is possible only with new kinds of special purpose chips.
The holy grail is a new kind of chip tailor-made for deep learning. That’s what Rao and Nervana are attempting. If they succeed, Intel too will bear the fruit.
Rao sports an athlete’s build in his T-shirt and blue jeans. A child of Indian immigrants, he grew up in a tiny eastern Kentucky town called Whitesburg. In the late 1970s, his father, a physicist turned physician, drove Rao and his brother to a Radio Shack in Hazard, 40 minutes away, where they wrote programs in Basic on floor-model computers. “We didn’t have a computer at home yet,” he says.
After a rural childhood that mixed outdoor sports with Dungeons & Dragons and novels by Asimov, Heinlein and Tolkien, Rao attended Duke University. There, he was attracted to neural networks after learning how the human eye detected edges on visual objects. Edge detection at the time was a cutting-edge problem in computer vision, with a number of solutions being offered up, including neural networks.
He cut his teeth on computer chips at Sun Microsystems in Silicon Valley. Still drawn by all things neural, he earned a PhD at Brown University under neuroscience pioneer John Donoghue. He headed back West to chipmaker Qualcomm in San Diego, on a team conducting neural net research.
Qualcomm is doing interesting work, Rao said. But he had specific ideas of his own and craved the freedom of a startup. In 2014, he founded Nervana. It wasn’t long before larger companies took an interest. When Intel found out another big tech company was sniffing around, Rao says, it moved quickly. Which was fine with Rao. More than anything, he sought a company that excelled at chip manufacturing. “The best at that is Intel,” he said.
Analysts concur. “They have the best manufacturing facilities in the world,” said Linley Gwennap, founder of The Linley Group and longtime semiconductor industry analyst. “With Intel, you also have the advantage of walking into a market with Intel’s name, Intel’s resources.”
Nervana is crafting a neural net computer chip that Intel will release by the end of the year, known as Lake Crest. Just as important, Intel and Nervana are coming up with sets of software tools developers can use to write deep learning programs.
A chip company called Nvidia, a rising star in Silicon Valley, has an early lead on Intel and all other neural net newcomers, including Advanced Micro Devices.
Gamers know Nvidia well. The company started out making graphics accelerators that worked with Intel chips to keep computer games from lagging. Nvidia continued to improve the chips as gamers demanded action in real time so they could compete with players online.
The company’s graphical processing units, or GPUs, were designed to cram thousands of “cores” into one chip that processed information in parallel. It turned out GPUs lend themselves to neural networks, too.
Nvidia discovered this around the time of what’s become known as the Google Cat Project, considered a milestone in deep learning research.  Show a neural network thousands of pictures of cats, and it learns how to recognize photos that include images of cats. The Google cat project in 2012 was carried out on 16,000 Intel central processors inside Google’s vast “farms” of computer servers. It took a month. Google could afford to do that, but not many others could.
Around the same time, forward-thinking hedge fund managers were trying to adapt deep learning to stock picking. They began using chips from Nvidia, whose graphic chips lent themselves to neural net processing better than anything made by Intel.
When Nvidia found out hedge funds and others were using its chips for deep learning, it made a quick strategic move: tailor its chips and develop software tools to support neural networks. Almost every major automaker is using Nvidia chips to develop driverless-car technology. Google, Amazon and others have been adding Nvidia chips to their data centers at a furious clip.
A few numbers illustrate the challenge Intel faces. Nvidia stock is up 180% over the past 52 weeks, closing at $180.76 on Thursday. Over the same period, Intel stock is up a penny, from $37.19 to $37.20.
Nvidia revenue grew to $6.9 billion in 2016, up 38%. Intel was up 7.3%, to $59.3 billion. Nvidia does have a much smaller revenue base. But consider profits: Nvidia up 171% to $1.6 billion, Intel down 9.7% to $10.3 billion.
Rao said the deep learning “kind of fell into Nvidia’s lap.” He added: “To their credit, they took full advantage of it.”
In a statement, Nvidia affirmed its commitment to artificial intelligence.
“Artificial intelligence is driving the greatest technology advances known to humankind,” the company said. “From diagnosing skin cancer using a photo to making our roads safer with self-driving cars, AI will automate intelligence and spur a wave of social progress unmatched since the industrial revolution.”
Rao sees a way to surpass Nvidia with chips designed not for computer games, but specifically for neural networks.
He’ll have to integrate them into the rest of Intel’s business. Artificial intelligence chips won’t work on their own. For a time, they’ll be tied into Intel’s CPUs at cloud data centers around the world, where Intel CPUs still dominate — often in concert with Nvidia chips.
Intel is on an acquisition spree. In 2016, it acquired Movidius, a Silicon Valley company that specializes in making smart vision chips for consumer devices, including drones. Earlier this year, it paid a whopping $15.3 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli maker of camera, chip and software systems for driverless cars.
It’s also partnered with a company that specializes in custom chips for specific applications, and bought another that makes chips whose “firmware” can be reprogrammed depending on the job at hand.
It needs to pull all those pieces together. When Intel bought Nervana, it deemed the small company the “foundation” of its foray into artificial intelligence. It put Rao in charge of all of Intel’s AI efforts, reporting directly to Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. (Krznaich declined comment for this story.)
But pulling off the merger will be tricky, in terms of culture and technical execution. Intel suffers a poor record with startup acquisitions, analyst Gwinnap said. Intel had a wireless-device chip unit before Apple introduced the iPhone, he noted, but sold it to Marvell Technology Group in 2006.
To try to correct its error, Intel bought the wireless unit of Infineon Technologies in 2010, but culture clashes and disagreements about technology knocked Intel out of the mobile game. Nimbler companies such as ARM Holdings (now part of SoftBank) ran away with mobile chips business.
Steve Jurvetson of DFJ Venture Capital, an early investor in Nervana, said Rao’s got the chops to help pull off a cultural change at Intel, if Intel will let him. “He’s a polymath, and he’s brilliant in his ability to integrate ideas across a lot of disciplines,” said Steve Jurvetson of DFJ Venture Capital. “He has a warm professorial kind of manner. He enjoys teaching others and debating the viability of their ideas. But he won’t hold back if he thinks something’s a bad idea.”
Rao said he’s encountered resistance from some of Intel’s old guard, but believes the company has left its Intel-always-knows-best past behind it.
Buying Nervana “is not something the Intel of five years ago would have done,” he said. “It’s an open culture. I can say, ‘Guys, you aren’t getting this.’” Sometimes, he’s found himself pounding on the table in meetings. But he said he’s confident that Krzanich has his back.
“Intel has an opportunity to match or surpass the kind of performance Nvidia is talking about,” Gwinnap said. “But just because you start from a blank sheet of paper doesn't mean you're going to come up with a masterpiece. Nothing is guaranteed.”

"On a road trip up the coast, I linger too long over lighthouses and eat way too much pie. Surprised?","I don’t even know what dreams I have left. They are diaphanous, semi-formed and live under the stairs. When I was 30, I had a long list of dreams.
At 60, they are written in Hi-Liter on the back of my hand. You can barely make them out: I dream about my wife getting healthy, my kids being content.
Unfortunately, contentment is nothing we really preach. Our nation started as Pilgrims, and we are now a jump-up-and-down, I-won-the-lottery sort of society. We lust for uncool things: fame, fortune, fashion, faster phones….
Trust me, finding contentment is winning the lottery.
Been a funny week. My sister in Chicago misspelled my name on a check (it used to be her last name too). How quickly they forget.
And I finally sold the Camaro, a car that had been for sale for seven years and was about to be buried in the backyard.
I lost my phone charger, then found it, then lost it again. Everything seemed misplaced. Two idiots wouldn’t return my calls. The 300-pound beagle wouldn’t take his kidney meds no matter what.
“You need to be more patient,” Posh suggested.
“I invented patience!!!” I screamed.
What followed was a 20-minute argument over whether I invented patience. Which I did.
So when my buddy Siskin invited me up the coast for a day or two, my wife was glad to let me go.
Off I went, in a cheesy rental car, ugly as a fire truck, on airless tires that rattled over every road seam. Stopped at Rincon Beach, then stopped for a steak so massive it should’ve come with a bell around its neck.
Just before sunset, I rolled into Cayucos, which is below Cambria but lots less artsy. If there’s anything I like about a place, it’s that it is less artsy.
Wow, what a place Siskin rented. Not that it was big — I’m so done with mansions. I can barely afford the one I have.
Siskin’s place was just right, with a living room that zoomed out to the sea. Perched on a bluff, it wasn’t a house so much as a hang-glider.
Like me, Siskin is a talker. We talked about books and the troubled relationship between hope and truth. We talked about the Clippers, the future of football, the birds bristling along the beach.
Siskin was certain they were snowy plovers. To me, they looked like common gulls with gym memberships — a little sleeker, a little more careful about what they ate.
“Yep, those are plovers,” Siskin insisted.
No one can quite explain my buddy Siskin. Or the ocean either. There are all sorts of theories about the positive vibes released by crashing waves or the psychic rewards of staring at the horizon.
Part of the reason California is such an asylum is that it is full of people who fixated on horizons, then set off to explore them. I like that in a place.
As the sun set, we sat on the deck and watched a parade of sea creatures. Is that an otter or a seal? No one could tell. Might’ve been a surfer. This far north, even the sea lions wear wetsuits.
In the distance, humpbacks spewed. Close to shore, a family of dolphins slipped through the waves; they were shiny, as if just painted.
Who doesn’t love dolphins? Do they deserve it? What have they really done? To me, a dolphin is a celebrity without merit, the Macaulay Culkin of the sea.
Siskin’s wife, Jenny, joined us, and we took long walks to nowhere. After that, we ate all the oysters in the ocean.
Immediately, I felt better.
Eating an oyster, Tom Robbins once noted, is like “French-kissing a mermaid,” so we ordered way too many. You either love oysters or you don’t. Jenny watched in horror, but she was a good sport about it. She hurled only twice.
After the hike, the September sun was warm on our necks and our legs still burned.
Amid its difficulties, God still has a crush on California. It has restorative powers that we often take for granted. There is medicine in the sunlight.
And, in California, the year gets better with every month, not worse, as in most states. September is better than August, and October is even better than September.
If I had my way, October would be 90 days long. Yet November is even better. Leave it said we’ll enjoy a damn fine harvest.
Later, I drove farther up the coast to do my usual dorky activities — lingering too long over lighthouses and eating too much rhubarb pie.
Like oceans, no one has ever sufficiently explained our love of lighthouses. Probably Longfellow came closest, noting that lighthouses are “steadfast, serene … a quenchless flame.”
Really, aren’t we all?

Becoming an American citizen in the age of Trump,"I felt my first real twinge of regret about not being a U.S. citizen in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected president.
Back in 1992, the American university where my father worked as a professor had helped secure green cards for my whole family. (I was 11 at the time.) I had renewed my green card twice since then. People often asked why I hadn’t applied for citizenship. This is the life I’m used to, I’d say: smugly returning jury notices, watching elections from a safe distance, standing in endless queues for travel visas, enduring taxation without representation.
The truth is I felt torn about swearing allegiance to a nation with such a horrific past — slavery, lynching, internment, Hiroshima, deportation, police brutality. But Obama seemed to transcend that history, to synthesize and neutralize it in his very body. He was born here, but, like me, he is mixed-race, black, Halfrican. I regretted not being able to vote for America’s first black president.
Then Donald Trump was elected president. For the first time in my life, I wanted to join a political protest, without fear of arrest and deportation. A week after he won the election, I put in my application for naturalization. A week after his inauguration, I had my biometric screening. A month after his second Muslim travel ban went into effect, I had my naturalization interview.
Over the last nine months, because of Trump’s presidency, I have learned more about American politics and history than I ever learned in high school, far more than I needed to know for my 10-question citizenship exam. I know all about filibustering and gerrymandering. I know what budget reconciliation is. I know when those Confederate monuments were built and why. I know that everyone in the U.S., regardless of immigration status, has the right to free speech — including the right to burn the American flag — and the right to bear arms. I know there is no official language of the U.S. I know what the 25th Amendment is.
My citizenship ceremony took place in Oakland in mid-August, mere days after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. It was held in the historic Paramount Theater, which was big enough to hold more than 1,000 newly minted citizens from more than 90 different countries, plus their cheering friends and families. The neo-Nazis in Charlottesville had hollered, “You will not replace us!” Some of them had even subbed in “Jews” for “you.” As I looked around the packed theater, I thought, “Well, actually…”
We, the new people of the United States of America, gave oaths in unison and sang “The Star-Spangled Banner.” We stood up to represent our old countries as their names were read aloud. (Zambia was last on the list; I was the only Zambian.) We clapped and waved little flags and laughed uproariously when a speaker joked that we would never again have to wait in an immigration line.
The line to submit our passport applications stretched out of the theater and into the street. As it inched along, I registered to vote and spent the rest of the hour chatting with a lovely Nigerian woman about the traumas of the past months, about our lives in America, about the citizenship application process. We each took pictures with a cardboard cutout of Obama dressed as a superhero. (Bless you, Oakland.)
I was hoping to receive an accidental letter of welcome from him rather than Trump, as hundreds of other newly naturalized citizens had. But when we received our precious envelopes in Oakland that day, there was no letter of welcome at all. Trump apparently hadn’t gotten around to writing and signing one. This feels especially fitting now that Trump has announced his intention to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. He has left the so-called Dreamers — children of immigrants, just like me — in torturous suspense.
California Supreme Court Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, also a naturalized citizen, gave the final speech at my naturalization ceremony. He exhorted us to believe that we belong here, that we are welcome. He told us that no one can tell us otherwise, “no matter how rich or poor they are, no matter which house they live in.” Then he paused. In that pause, the word “house” seemed to grow a capital letter and acquire the word “White” before it.
Still, I have chosen to become a U.S. citizen. I feel proud to be a U.S. citizen at a time like this. And I feel ashamed to be a U.S. citizen at a time like this. This ambivalence, I have come to realize, is the most American thing about me.

There are 3 types of single-payer 'concern trolls' — and they all want to undermine universal healthcare,"California and New York become the latest states to consider single-payer health insurance systems as Congressional Republicans prioritize repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. (Sept. 12, 2017)


California and New York become the latest states to consider single-payer health insurance systems as Congressional Republicans prioritize repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. (Sept. 12, 2017)
With momentum building for single-payer healthcare among Democratic voters and a growing number of 2020 hopefuls, Sen. Bernie Sanders unveiled a “Medicare for All” bill last week. Immediately, a number of pundits denounced the legislation as an “unrealistic” “bloated” “disaster” full of “magic math.”
Some of the naysayers are conservatives who simply abhor “big government.” Some have perfectly valid reasons to question the merits of single payer in general or Sanders’ methods in particular. Yet others claim they support universal healthcare in theory (one day, perhaps) but cannot do so now because of a “concern.” They are “concern trolls” — broadly defined as “a person who disingenuously expresses concern about an issue with the intention of undermining or derailing genuine discussion.”
Less than 24 hours after the bill’s introduction, New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait lamented that the bill gets America “zero percent” closer to single payer. While saying he agrees with single payer in theory, he insisted that the 155 million Americans who already have healthcare represent an insuperable barrier, and that the issue of how to move them all to a government-run system “is not a detail to be worked out. It is the entire problem.” As he noted, Lyndon Johnson failed and Hillary Clinton failed and Barack Obama failed to undo the private system. So why bother? It’s too hard; everyone go home.
Nuance trolling is argument by way of tautology, an attempt to pass off power-serving defeatism as savvy pragmatism. Nuance trolls simply cannot envision a bold legislative movement to alter the system.
Even if Sanders did lay out how a single-payer transition would work in a technical sense, nuance trolls would find other nits to pick. Where would the money come from? How would you manage all the corporations disturbed? There’s always some essential detail that needs solving before Senate Democrats earn the right to support a bold policy.
And if the demand for nuance seems reasonable enough, consider that pundits rarely require it when it comes to military interventions — Chait and others set this issue aside when it came to invading Iraq in 2003, for instance. The idea at the time was: This is an urgent threat, we will rush to solve it and sort out the details later. With an estimated 45,000 people dying a year because of a lack of healthcare and almost half of the money raised on GoFundMe used to pay medical bills, we must ask: How is this crisis any less urgent?
Of all the water-muddying tactics, this one is the easiest to set aside. As I’ve noted in these pages before, deficit scare-mongering is used, almost exclusively, as a bludgeon to smear progressive policy proposals. When it comes to launching wars or bailing out banks, these fears vanish.
Articles in the Washington Post, Vox and Think Progress all asked how Sanders’ single-payer bill would be “paid for,” yet not a single one of those outlets asked the same question the day after the Senate signed a $700-billion military spending bill, an increase of roughly 13% from 2017. (That $80 billion increase alone could cover 2017-2018 tuition for every student at a 4-year state university in the country.) Money for war is magically always there; money for healthcare must be counted bean by bean.
Many pundits seem to believe that leftist politicians must preemptively agree internally to some assumed compromise that is “practical” even before attempting to change the conversation, much less the law. Thus feasibility trolls argue that GOP opposition to government-run health insurance renders futile any such proposal.
That’s ahistorical. Maximalist demands aren’t all or nothing, they’re about establishing broad moral goals that people can rally around.
Indeed, the Tea Party movement provided a clear counterexample to conventional wisdom. It routinely held “unrealistic” positions such as shutting down the entire U.S. government and establishing a 14.5% flat tax, but nonetheless went on to help the GOP net 900 seats nationwide as well as the White House and both houses of Congress.
To have seen this play out and still conclude that maximalism can’t work is perplexing. Progressives lose nothing by setting bold targets right out of the gate. Why not make every Republican lawmaker go back to his or her constituents in 2018 and explain opposition to free healthcare? Force the issue, shift the debate, just as the far right has been doing for years.
President Eisenhower — an early practitioner of concern trolling — told the New York Times in 1957 that he supported integration “in principle” but said activists in the South risked going “too far, too fast.” Give it more time. We need more details. Who will pay for it? All meaningful changes to society have been met with these types of objections. But the game of politics isn’t won by waiting for the ideal. Its most successful actors establish a moral goal and fight for it until reality catches up to them.

"Graham-Cassidy: Another day, another lousy GOP healthcare bill","It’s “Groundhog Day” for congressional Republicans: Rush out a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, see it fail, rush out a bill again, see it fail, rush out a third bill, see it fail — following the same basic playbook over and over in the hope that somehow the end result will change.
The latest proposal — by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) — suffers from the same fundamental problems as all of its predecessors. Aiming to lower insurance costs for the healthy, it would allow states to herd people with preexisting conditions or potentially expensive risks — say, women who might want maternity coverage — into insurance gulags with egregiously high premiums.
Not content just to roll back the expansion of Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act, it would cap funding in a way that would threaten services for Medicaid’s core beneficiaries, including impoverished disabled people and families. Pandering to social conservatives, it would cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood and deny low-income Americans subsidies for private insurance policies that cover abortion (a ban that would rule out aid to Californians, given that state law mandates such coverage in every policy).
Although it would overhaul the way millions of Americans pay for health insurance and treatment, the measure has undergone no formal public scrutiny and only limited expert analysis. And if it nevertheless managed to become law, Graham-Cassidy would produce many of the same unwelcome results as its failed forebears: more uninsured Americans, and millions of others facing higher premiums and deductibles for the coverage they have today.
What makes the Graham-Cassidy bill different are its cost and complexity, as well as the blatant shifting of taxpayer dollars from (mostly) blue states to red ones. Unlike the other proposals, it would keep almost all of the tax hikes in the Affordable Care Act in place, raising about $1.2 billion by 2026. The money would flow to states in the form of block grants with few strings attached, in the hope of spurring innovative approaches to insuring lower-income people and those not covered by group plans at work. But in another twist, it would change where those healthcare dollars went, gradually transferring federal aid from the 31 states that had expanded Medicaid to the 19 that had not.
Although the block grants technically would have to be spent on healthcare-related programs, such as subsidies to attract more insurers and bring down premiums, they wouldn’t actually require states to spend more than they’re already spending. Instead, the grants could free states to spend more of their own dollars on roads, prisons or other programs instead of healthcare.
The big winners would be deeply red states that have spent comparatively little on healthcare for their residents, such as Oklahoma, Mississippi and Kansas. The losers would be states with large healthcare budgets, such as California and Massachusetts.
The bill’s sponsors frame this as basic fairness, as money would be provided to almost every state at the same rate per low-income resident. But that’s hogwash. Just like food and housing, healthcare costs more in some states than others — and in some cases, much more. The measure also uses a formula for divvying up dollars that would make it difficult, if not impossible, for a state to keep covering impoverished people who don’t qualify for traditional Medicaid. So the “freedom” it provides for state innovation doesn’t seem to extend to that particularly vulnerable portion of the population.
Oh, and by the way, the new block grants would evaporate in 2027 — a gimmick to meet a federal requirement that such measures not raise the federal deficit over the long term. But the move would only force another bitter fight over healthcare policy before the grants run out, while making a mockery of long-term planning for doctors and health plans.
It’s hard to say with much precision how many people might lose coverage under Graham-Cassidy, considering how many decisions would be left up to the states. The one thing it would be sure to do is make increasingly deep cuts in federal support for Medicaid and insurance subsidies while doing absolutely nothing to slow the rising cost of healthcare.
There are problems in some states’s insurance markets that need to be addressed, and a bipartisan effort to do so showed promise before Republicans pulled the plug on it this week. The Graham-Cassidy proposal, on the other hand, may only make the individual insurance market more unstable — and inhospitable to people with preexisting conditions or limited means. There’s a lot to be said for states’ role as laboratories of innovation in healthcare. But supplying less money to cover more costs is just a formula for failure.

10 points to keep in mind about housing affordability in California,"Many politicians and activists push simplistic solutions when it comes to California’s housing woes. Some promote subsidies; others density. Some sell infill as the solution; others blame everything on the state’s byzantine laws. Maybe I'm getting old, or maybe the election of 2016 just reminded me to beware of politicians appealing to the masses with buzzwords. We live in a complex world, and remedies for complex problems such as housing are complex.
Nuance and straight talk will help us solve this crisis. With that in mind, I crafted these 10 points to inform the debate.
1. Subsidies for affordable housing average around $357,000 per unit. Do the math — that’s unsustainable. If Sacramento were to subsidize just Los Angeles’ needs for just one year, that would consume the entire state budget.
2. I generally support density, but it is not a panacea, as places such as Manhattan prove. Many cities’ natural boundaries mean that prices there will always be rather high. Furthermore, supply can actually create, rather than sate, demand. When more people can move to a place, others must also live nearby to service the growing population. This, in turn, pushes up prices.
3. Many of the same people freaking out about high home prices at the top of the market were those petrified of buying at the bottom. Today is not forever. California real estate prices have been subject to clear and regular cycles since statehood. In three to five years, housing might well be cheap again. But the consequences of bad decisions can last much longer.
4. Several factors explain the high cost of construction. For example, our building and zoning laws are needlessly byzantine. Because there is no single problem, there is no single, magical solution. Developers in Monaco face nothing similar to California’s bureaucracy, but a combination of other factors still make housing there quite expensive.
5. We’re not going to change immutable economic truths such as supply and demand, and we’re unlikely to change human nature. Many people are revolutionary when they are young and NIMBY when they are old.
6. Affordability solutions create new responsibilities. For example, if a city increases its housing stock, it must make sure it has enough water and transportation options. Otherwise, those cities will just shrink later as they become unlivable.
7. People want to live where there are jobs and culture. For years, government has tried to subsidize housing in expensive areas. But rather than bring housing where there are jobs, maybe we should try to foster more jobs where there is abundant housing. Making inexpensive areas more livable would also help bridge the gap between rich and poor in California. If an employer is willing to relocate to an area with cheap housing and core infrastructure (transit, water, healthcare), then our policies should facilitate that.
8. Housing in Manhattan, San Francisco, Silicon Valley and many Los Angeles neighborhoods has become a Veblen good. Like a Fendi purse, the more exclusive some goods appear and the more expensive their price, the more desirable they become to certain consumers. The people engaging in absurd bidding wars, driving up the cost of real estate in tony neighborhoods, are not dissuaded by stratospheric prices. In fact, it makes those neighborhoods even more attractive to some.
9. One factor in skyrocketing home prices in the last decade has been the Federal Reserve. It has been creating trillions of dollars to buy government bonds and prop up the economy. That makes the value of dollars (and interest rates) sink and the value of assets (such as houses) rise. Programs such as housing subsidies that reduce costs are just a drop when compared to the immense bucketful of money that has increased asset prices. Activists should start focusing some of their attention on national monetary policy.
10. While having a roof over your head is a human right, being hip is not. Even during times of unprecedented price increases, there are often bargains to be had in places that are a little less trendy. Some, but not all, of the complaints about affordability come from people who are simply frustrated that they can’t live in the stylish neighborhood of their choice.

Puppy mills are hubs of animal cruelty. We don't need their business in California,"Puppy mills are essentially the factory farms of dog breeding. But shutting them down is almost impossible. California Assembly Bill 485 does the next best thing. It cuts off the supply of animals from those puppy mills into one of their biggest markets in the country—California pet stores. The Pet Rescue and Adoption Act, which was authored by Assembly Members Patrick O'Donnell (D-Long Beach) and Matt Dababneh (D-Woodland Hills), would prohibit pet stores in the state from selling dogs, cats and rabbits obtained from commercial breeders, allowing them to carry only animals from shelters and rescue groups. The bill sailed through the Assembly and the Senate and now awaits Gov. Jerry Brown’s signature. There’s no question that he should sign it.
The bill’s sponsor, Judie Mancuso, founder and president of Social Compassion in Legislation, says the bill will not only eliminate high-volume cruelly bred animals in pet stores but also “will allow over half a million pets normally euthanized annually in California a greater chance for adoption.” Other animal welfare organizations, including the Humane Society of the U.S., support this bill.
This measure is crucial to thwarting the sale of puppies bred and raised under the notoriously deplorable conditions of high-volume commercial breeders. They overuse their female dogs and crowd animals into dirty, often fetid cages, all for the business of churning out sought-after pedigreed and designer puppies that can command thousands of dollars in pet stores.
Yes, these breeders must be inspected and licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. So must similarly-sized online sellers if their customers buy their pets sight unseen.
However, the vast majority of commercial breeders don't comply — about 80% of the estimated 10,000 U.S. commercial breeders go unlicensed. And for even the ones that do, the standards set by the Animal Welfare Act are so abysmally low that breeders can keep animals in cramped cages, give them water as infrequently as twice a day, and breed females continuously to the detriment of their health. The worst offenders, who fall short of even the minimal standards, get cited but may remain licensed despite repeated violations.
That’s why California needs this state law — to make up for a weak animal welfare law and ineffective federal enforcement. It would be the first statewide ban, however more than 200 jurisdictions across the country have ordinances similar to this one. At least 33 are California cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Irvine.
It may seem unfair to put the onus for stopping bad breeders on pet store owners who sell puppies that they buy legally from commercial breeders. Nor does it seem fair to cut off commercial breeders that are humane — assuming there are some. But the combination of low standards and lax enforcement has helped entrench the business of inhumanely manufacturing animals, particularly puppies. The abuses are so widespread that there's no way for pet store shoppers or even the stores themselves to know for sure that the dogs they are buying were raised humanely. And there are plenty of ways for pet stores to make money besides selling live animals — they can sell food, toys and all manner of pet accessories that pet owners love to accumulate.
Of course, bad breeders could still sell online — even though they are supposed to be inspected, maybe, once a year. But brick-and-mortar pet stores are a crucial outlet for these puppy mills, and they need to be cut off as soon as possible. Let’s worry about online sales separately.
And anyone who wants a pedigreed puppy can always find a responsible breeder — people who breed their female dogs carefully, offer plenty of space for their animals, and, most important, welcome you to come and see where their dogs are bred and raised.
California has an opportunity to stem the tide of animals coming out of these wretched puppy mills. Gov. Brown should sign this bill and let California do just that.

Toronto International Film Festival puts tomorrow's stars through celebrity boot camp,"When Vinnie Bennett first walked into a gifting lounge at the Toronto International Film Festival, he was handed some complimentary bags of M&Ms. Sure, he could have bought the candy for a few bucks at a local drugstore. But frankly, he was just happy to be given anything for free.
After all, as one of the seven actors selected to participate in TIFF’s Rising Stars program, he’d already been gifted an IWC watch worth roughly $3,000. M&Ms were just a bonus at this point.
But then he spotted a tattoo artist setting up an inking station. “You want a tattoo?” asked Mr. Koo, who has his own local shop.
“Yeah, sure thing,” the 25-year-old New Zealander replied sarcastically.
But Koo was serious. Bennett already had ink all over his arms, so he wasn’t opposed to the idea — but he wasn’t sure what tattoo to get. He tried to think of something sentimental, like his mother’s name — “something deep.” Koo steered him in another direction.
The tattoo artist “was, like, ‘Yeah, sure, man. But I don’t know — it’s a gifting lounge,’” Bennett recalled. “ ‘I’ve drawn up some ideas for today, and if you like any, I’d be keen to do one of those.’ ”
Bennett settled on a design depicting a bear riding a unicycle because he thought it looked “hilarious.” The entire thing, which he got on his upper ankle, took 20 minutes.
“I’m still at the stage where I’m really quite a sucker for free” stuff,  Bennett acknowledged with a laugh. “People develop this ability to refuse it over time, but I’m not there yet. I’m like, ‘Yes, yes, yes! Food? Tattoo? Anything — let’s do it.’ ”
Bennett got far more than some free ink in Canada. For four days during the film festival, he and six other up-and-coming actors — Mamoudou Athie, 28, Jessie Buckley, 27, Lina El Arabi, 22, Mary Galloway, 26, Théodore Pellerin, 20, and Ellen Wong, 32 — participated in an industry boot camp of sorts, being media trained, picking the brains of casting directors and walking the red carpet at swanky premieres. (An eighth actor, Daniel Doheny, was also invited to attend but couldn't make it to the festival.)
It was all part of the annual Rising Stars program put on by TIFF, which the festival launched seven years ago. Initially, the four-day event was meant to serve as an incubator for Canadian talent.
“We’d see an actor in the Canadian star system get a certain amount of success and then boot it to the States,” explained Natalie Semotiuk, who’s been producing the program since 2015. “This was created in order to show that Canadians foster great talent — but also that we have a place to celebrate it.”
There have already been a number of Rising Stars who have gone on to international success in recent years, including Sarah Gadon (“Alias Grace”), Stephan James (“Race”) and Tatiana Maslany, the “Orphan Black” Emmy winner who was back at the festival to premiere her new Boston Marathon bombing drama, “Stronger.”

“I think it’s a great foot in the door in terms of getting into the industry,” said Maslany, a native of Regina, Saskatchewan. “Any kind of training for this [media] world is good, because so much of it is a weird byproduct of the job and a whole other skill set. I’m so glad I did it.”
Since Maslany was a participant in 2012, the Rising Stars program has expanded beyond Canada, this year welcoming four international actors into its ranks. While Canadians have to fill out a written application and submit a video interview, those from outside the country were nominated by festival programmers and all appeared in at least one movie at TIFF. Roughly 100 Canadians applied for the 2017 program, Semotiuk said, while about 60 international stars were considered.
One of the stars who traveled from overseas this year was Lina El Arabi, a 22-year-old French actress who appeared in two festival films, playing a pregnant Pakistani teen in “Noces” and working with director Kim Nguyen (whose “War Witch” earned an Oscar nomination for foreign language film) in “Eye on Juliet.”
El Arabi was one of most outspoken at a Filmmaker Speed Dating event, where the young group had the opportunity to dine with a handful of industry veterans like Justine Bateman and Patricia Rozema. After the stars chose a seat, they had  20 minutes to engage in discussion with the filmmaker opposite them, before moving on to chat with another director.
El Arabi was initially seated across from Clement Virgo, a Canadian director who is currently an executive producer of the OWN series “Greenleaf.” He began their conversation by asking if she was on Twitter or Instagram. El Arabi responded that  though she is on Twitter — she has  fewer than 600 followers — she adamantly dislikes Instagram.
“If I were on Instagram right now, I would not be talking to you,” she said. “I see a lot of people who don’t enjoy life and present an image. It’s just about showing to other people that your life is so cool.”
Virgo pressed further.
“So if you were to have a film that’s very successful, and Chanel wanted you to be a model for an ad, or Lancome or any of those big companies, would you do it? You’ve had a good career, it’s going well, and suddenly they want you to be the face of a perfume.”
“It’s not what we do,” she insisted. “We’re not here for that.”
“Really?” he asked, visibly shocked. “Even for money? Even for 500,000 euros?”
“Today, I don’t have a lot of money, but I’m fine,” El Arabi explained. “I’m not poor, but even if I’m very poor, I’m happy. I don’t need a lot of money. For what? A car, and a second car, and a boat, and the Eiffel Tower?”
Virgo smiled and went on to tell El Arabi how whenever he goes to cast an actress in a film or a television show these days, he is immediately asked by distributors how many followers his potential star has. Once, he admitted, he actually cast an actress because she had 3 million followers. At first, he fought against the choice, but ultimately realized her social media presence could prove helpful to the project.
“I tell you this because obviously you have talent and you’re young and you have a long career ahead of you,” said Virgo, noting that he also shared a disdain for sharing his life online. “So you might want to have someone else do it for you. Maybe you hire someone to help you build up your Twitter and Instagram followers. Unfortunately, it’s a reality.”
A few days after Speed Dating, the Rising Stars gathered at a luncheon held in their honor hosted by the head of IMDB and actress Shohreh Aghdashloo.
Athie, who had spent the festival juggling the boot camp with promotional duties for Brie Larson’s “Unicorn Store,” looked tired. He tried to mask his fatigue while mixing with the crowd, shaking hands and trying to accept compliments modestly.
“Even when you come fresh out of school, unless you have mentors that you cultivate on your own, it can be very difficult,” said the Yale School of Drama graduate, stepping away from the onlookers. “And these guys?” he said, pointing to his fellow Rising Stars. “They’re so chill and fun. So unpretentious. Friends for life, every single one of them.”
Of the eight in the group, Athie was arguably the best known coming into the festival, having just appeared in the critically acclaimed Sundance festival favorite “Patti Cakes.” But in the days since the event wrapped, some of the other Rising Stars already seem to be capitalizing on the momentum from the fest. On Tuesday, Deadline Hollywood reported that English actress Buckley was signed by CAA, while Bennett landed with Primary Wave Entertainment. Maybe he’ll be able to start paying for his own tattoos soon, too.

"Lady Gaga gets personal in her new documentary 'Gaga: Five Foot Two,' but can't overcome clichés","Less than 10 minutes into the 100-minute “Gaga: Five Foot Two,” a cinéma vérité-style documentary about Lady Gaga that emulates Madonna’s 1991 documentary “Truth or Dare,” the “Poker Face” pop star complains that she’s been unfairly accused of stealing Madonna’s style and sound.
“I could never wrap my head around the fact [that Madonna] wouldn’t look me in the eye and tell me I was reductive. I saw it on TV,” says Gaga (a.k.a. Stefani Germanotta), in a film so similar to that other film you have to wonder if Gaga isn’t aiming for another publicity-generating admonishment from Madge.
Ample massage-table scenes: Check. Pep talks with her dancers before the big show: Check. Traveling in chauffeur-driven cars and private planes chock full of makeup artists, hair stylists and handlers: Check. Feelings of loneliness expressed from a fabulous hotel room: Check.
But what in pop music — or any entertainment medium, for that matter — is entirely original? Like a vintage clothing store, artists take what’s been worn before and reassemble it into a new fashion, informed by their own individual sense of style.
The problem with “Five Foot Two,” which arrives Friday on Netflix and in theaters, is that it’s a disjointed pastiche of generic pop-star clichés. Unless you’re already a die-hard fan, it doesn’t provide enough insight to explain why viewers should see this film now — other than to promote a new phase of Gaga’s career — and why we should care about the woman behind those catchy hits.
Directed by visual artist Chris Moukarbel and co-produced by Gaga, the film focuses on the year surrounding the release of her last album, “Joanne,” and her 2017 Super Bowl halftime performance in February.
It was a reboot period of sorts for the artist. In the film she expresses her desire to drop some of the theatrics that made her a name nearly a decade ago — the flamboyant costumes such as the meat dress, the flashy pop sound — and head in a more personal direction with her style and sound.
What she doesn’t say in the film is that the revamp was also necessary for survival: Gaga’s career showed signs of flagging after her meteoric rise to fame. She came out of an era when young women such as Kesha found fame through the dance pop hits they made with older, accomplished male producers such as Dr. Luke.
Gaga, however, created a niche all her own: she cast herself as an outcast, a performer who deviated from the usual glamour game by making herself “ugly.” The fright wigs, the prosthetic body humps, the melting makeup. The idea was that girls shouldn’t have to be “pretty” to make their mark. It was a rallying cry for self-proclaimed misfits, and it attracted a huge audience whose bond with the singer is personal.
But as times changed and her shtick didn’t, a new approach was needed. And as an artist, she naturally wanted to grow. Thus the new, stripped-down album inspired by the legacy of an aunt who died before she was born, and the move into acting. She has a leading role in the forthcoming “A Star Is Born” remake, directed by and starring Bradley Cooper.
Coincidentally, the film is mentioned less than five minutes into “Five Foot Two,” when she’s asked why there are dozens of star-shaped, Mylar balloons lining the staircase of her mansion. “Oh, Warner Bros. green-lit a movie,” she says casually, as she climbs the stairs in low-slung sweat pants. “Bradley wanted me to be in it ... I’m gonna star in the movie.”
These sorts of lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous scenes could be great and even revealing if balanced with deeper insight into the lady behind the fame, but that doesn’t happen here often enough.
It’s clear she’s in physical and mental pain caused by debilitating bouts of what she describes as horrible muscle spasms. (She has since revealed via social media that she’s been diagnosed with fibromyalgia). In one scene, Gaga is convalescing on a couch or bed, covered in ice packs, tears rolling down her face from the pain. You feel the pain. You suffer with her.
Other meaningful moments: her heartbroken comments about a recent breakup with her fiancé, “Chicago Fire” star Taylor Kinney; a moving scene with her grandmother where they revisit the death of Aunt Joanne. But they are outliers in a film predominantly made up of purposeless material.
Subject matter that should be substantial is rendered cliché by the shallow way in which it’s handled: Gaga talks about the rigors of trying to be taken seriously in a male-dominated industry, but the film never illustrates how she overcame those challenges. How was she brought up? How did she gravitate toward music? What made her who she is? And who is she?
Stilted talks between the singer and her crew about her boy problems, her hopes for her new album and the love she has of her fans feel like clumsy setups. “Candid” moments in the kitchen feel staged, and even then, they’re dull.
Madonna’s “Truth or Dare” was also an orchestrated look into the singer’s life. Did we get to know a lot about Madonna? No, only what she wanted us to know. It was another rehearsed show, but done with her knack for entertaining while provoking. Engineered entertainment, clean and precise, a production that had fun with its own vapid nature.
“Five Foot Two” is too amateurish to do any of that, let alone cut its own path. A star isn’t born here, she’s diminished.

"'Make New History,' the second Chicago Architecture Biennial, brings the focus back to square one","Architecture has taken an extrospective turn in recent years, looking outside itself for new ideas and to measure its progress. Or maybe just to feel more useful in a world flooding, burning and otherwise coming apart at the seams. Among its most visible and lauded figures have been dedicated populists like Chile’s Alejandro Aravena. It has made engagement — political, humanitarian and environmental — a key priority.
“Make New History,” the second edition of the Chicago Architecture Biennial, shifts the focus back inward. This elegant and densely layered exhibition, organized by the Los Angeles architects Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee, argues that architecture can (and should) find the motivation for new work within the discipline itself, within its own stores of self-knowledge and tradition.
As the title suggests, “Make New History” takes as its explicit theme the return to the past, to architectural precedent, that’s increasingly a touchstone for younger architects. It’s true that emerging and midcareer firms are these days producing work that’s grounded in history — and even prehistory, with buildings that look less neoclassical than primitive or primordial — to a degree not seen since the 1970s and ’80s.
Yet history shares top billing in this biennial with the argument Johnston and Lee want to make about architects and self-reliance, about a return to architectural first principles. The exhibition is as much about archetypes as history per se; it’s a portrait of a profession that — as Anna Neimark, of the L.A. firm First Office, put it during one of many opening-weekend panels — is “not pushing boundaries” but instead “coming back to the center” after recent dalliances with global capital, can-you-top-this form-making and work in service of political and ecological causes.
Each of those muses, the show suggests, drew architecture dangerously far from itself, diluting its power and chipping away at its autonomy. To underscore that point — and it’s telling that this quietly polemical biennial gets its message across as much by what it leaves out as what it includes — the exhibition features very few digital screens and even fewer renderings of expensive, formally adventurous new projects or statistics charting the various crises, planetary and otherwise, that architecture might be enlisted to tackle. In place of the earnestness that has marked so many architecture shows in recent years, their save-the-world drive, this one is cerebral, well-tailored and faintly ironic.
The show’s awkward home base is again the Chicago Cultural Center, across Michigan Avenue from Millennium Park. Johnston and Lee deal at least as well with the building’s limitations and idiosyncrasies as the directors of the inaugural 2015 show, Sarah Herda and Joseph Grima. This biennial arranges projects across three floors, in large gallery spaces as well as corners, along ramps and corridors and on broad landings.
The most dramatic displays come in two of the building’s biggest rooms. On the high-ceilinged top floor Johnston and Lee have staged a new version, starring some of architecture’s most talented emerging firms, of the famously influential Tribune Tower competition of 1922. As part of a display of oversized models called “Vertical City,” those firms have proposed new towers that are closer in scale to the 36-story Tribune building than the so-called supertalls now crowding together in Dubai, Shanghai and elsewhere.
(This new effort is also a nod to the 1980 restaging of the 1922 original by Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman and others, which they called “Late Entries to the Chicago Tribune Competition.” The return to history is a story that gets repeatedly retold in architecture, each time building on earlier attempts; it is always a hall of mirrors.)
Not every tower in this ad hoc skyline succeeds, but there are a number of standouts, including work by Christ & Gantenbein (the generic facade of parking garage extruded to tower height) and Sam Jacob Studio (a stacked collage).
One floor below is a complementary “Horizontal City” with smaller entries by two-dozen firms, including several founded by young Los Angeles architects. The 2015 biennial banished celebrity architects such as Renzo Piano, Jean Nouvel, Frank Gehry and Norman Foster. In this biennial they stay banished, giving room for architects a generation or two younger to further establish themselves. (“A biennial is not an all-star show,” Lee told me.)
In another echo of the 2015 show, this one makes a point of breaking out of the Cultural Center and positioning events around the city. During the opening weekend there were performance pieces at Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth House in Plano, Ill. (where L.A.’s Gerard & Kelly sent dancers careening through the interior, down its travertine steps and across its lawn) and at Chicago’s Garfield Park Conservatory (where a meditation on air, breathing and the environment from the New York firm SO-IL and artist Ana Prvacki, with music by the Los Angeles composer Veronika Krausas, hid four musicians inside thin, white prophylactic suits that suggested a charmingly low-tech combination of mascot outfits, air filters and the gear beekeepers wear).
There were also panel discussions all over town. Most of these matched the main show’s insistence on a conversation pitched first and foremost to architects, with less concern about how meaningful it will be to the general public. This is a biennial about the particular combination of craft and expertise unique to the profession. (“An architect is a bricklayer who studied Latin,” Lee said during one panel, quoting Adolf Loos.) At a moment when expertise of all kinds is under attack, to see an unwavering declaration of support for it in architecture is most welcome.
At the same time, the exhibition occasionally piles up so many layers of self-referential material that it loses some valuable momentum as it pauses to chase its own tail. This happens most obviously in the Horizontal City installation, where the various designs are mounted on an archipelago of white pedestals. Participating firms began with an important photograph of an architectural interior and made a new project riffing on that image. Johnston and Lee then arranged the pedestals so that as a group they match the site plan of Mies van der Rohe’s campus plan for the Illinois Institute of Technology.
It’s all fantastic food for thought — and at least one curatorial layer too many. It’s a strange fact about this biennial that it wants to return to the architectural basics yet seems so uncomfortable allowing basic architecture to stand on its own.
Johnston and Lee do a better job balancing ideas, images and atmosphere in a room created jointly by London’s Caruso St. John Architects, the photographer Helene Binet and the artist Thomas Demand. Photographs of the firm’s work by Binet are set against wallpaper by Demand; architectural models on a table and Demand’s own photographs are also included.
This room is the high point of the show. The ratio of information to thematic effect is just right. It’s also an example of the major emphasis this biennial puts on photography, in diverse and surprising ways.
Other significant motifs in the exhibition include the return of bold color (in the work of L.A.’s Atelier Manferdini and Zago Architecture and Portugal’s Bak Gordon Arquitectos); slowness and accretion (Point Supreme of Athens); grids (UrbanLab, Christ & Gantenbein and Productora); the roof or ceiling as a site of formal exploration (Toshiko Mori, Philipp Schaerer); the architectural model as subject in its own right (Sylvia Lavin, Erin Besler and Norman Kelley); satire (Keith Krumwiede); craft (Aranda\Lasch and Beijing’s ZAO/standardarchitecture); and an unmistakable elementalism or primitivism, reducing buildings and architectural ideas to their most basic or indivisible form (the Belgian firm Dogma and Chile’s Pezo von Ellrichshausen, among many others). The shadows of Loos, Tigerman and of course Mies, the German modernist turned Chicagoan, are everywhere.
Johnston and Lee have said one model for their biennial was the Japanese architect Kazuyo Sejima’s 2010 Venice Architecture Biennale, the finest architecture exhibition of the last decade by a significant margin and one that moved viewers through spaces that went from crowded to airy, textual to visual, and back again. Their show doesn’t match the exceptionally sensitive choreography of Sejima’s, though that’s a high bar.
A more useful comparison is with the Venice  Biennale that Aravena directed last year. If his vernacular Venice installations rang with echoes of Bernard Rudofsky’s 1975 Museum of Modern Art exhibition “Architecture Without Architects,” what Johnston and Lee have organized is, pointedly, a biennial that can’t and won’t do without them.
If Aravena’s Bienniale stayed close to the ground, the Chicago exhibition reaches for the rarefied air occupied by a group of talented and well-connected emerging architects; if that show was earthy, made of mud bricks, this one is crisply executed, made of white building models, photo paper and glossy acrylic.
For the most part Johnston and Lee’s approach produces a subtle, exquisite attention to detail and to the art of building. It also leaves their exhibition feeling sealed off from certain pressing issues — climate change, the refugee crisis and housing are engaged briefly, if at all — and some architectural controversies now roiling its host city. Two topics that would seem ideal material for a show about history and held in Chicago (save maybe for the political headaches that including them might have caused for Johnston and Lee) are missing from the Cultural Center displays.
The first is the Obama Presidential Center by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, planned for a site in Jackson Park on Chicago’s South Side. Talk about making new history: Obama, controversially, wants to reinvent the presidential library, cleaving it from the National Archives. And he wants to chew up parkland by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux to do so.
The other is Helmut Jahn’s Thompson Center in the North Loop, a 1985 wonder of eccentric postmodernism that is threatened with demolition. The question of how (or perhaps whether) to save this strange, candy-colored and affecting building, with its mashup of L.A.’s Bradbury Building and High Tech architecture, would have been a perfect challenge to put to one or more teams in the show.
This biennial’s title, “Make New History,” is borrowed from a 2009 Ed Ruscha work that takes the form of a book with 600 blank pages. The nod to Ruscha tells you almost everything you need to know about Johnston and Lee’s strategy here. To begin with, the title does double duty: It introduces the idea of a return to history but is also, framed as it is in the second-person imperative, an admonition, or maybe an encouragement, directed squarely at architects.
Just as important, this is a show conceived by architects who are dedicated students of the field’s history (not least its interactions with the art world) but who hope, precisely by this process of re-centering, to lay out a series of blank pages where their colleagues can imagine sketching out new work.
As Lee told me, speaking of the show’s inward-looking emphasis, “We think it’s momentary. Within the architecture community it’s useful to focus on the center. But once you get resituated, you have the confidence — you can deal with a lot of things.”
That’s a strong stance as far as it goes, and even a brave one: Johnston and Lee have not been afraid to use the show to make a provocative argument about architecture’s need to to reset itself — and rely on itself.
Yet a surprising thing happened between the time they first sketched out their biennial theme and the show’s opening. History of a much less hermetic or playful variety than is on display in the exhibition came roaring back.
Charlottesville, “blood and soil,” debates over Confederate statues and college buildings named for white supremacists: these are markers of a different kind of return to history, one that directly implicates architecture. In this atmosphere, as a growing number of Americans seem eager to show off a conviction that the Civil War never ended, to mount a show that stresses both the theme of history and the value of architecture’s distance from the rest of the culture feels — at the very least — like unfortunate timing.
 Is it possible to have a return to history in architecture that’s apolitical, or political only within the field itself? Is it wise? We tried that at least once before, in the 1980s, as postmodernism softened in its middle age from an insurgent movement powered by theory to a largely decorative and scenographic one. I’m not sure we want to take that path again. Especially not right now.
This is hardly a case of architects fiddling while Rome burns. Johnston and Lee are too thoughtful, too conscientious, to be guilty of that. Maybe more like getting “resituated,” to use Lee’s term, while much of America seethes.

"Silence is golden? In the age of noise, filmmakers are suddenly embracing the quiet","Some of the most notable scenes of the recent summer movie season involved great sights and spectacles — and little to no talking.
In several of the biggest upcoming fall releases, directors have crafted memorable characters out of a mute janitor, a deaf young girl and a near-silent victim of a Cambodian genocide.
Film dialogue is for suckers?
After a generation of scripts from the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Aaron Sorkin celebrated the motor-mouthed and the silver-tongued, many directors are embracing a new moment. They’re making movies that include long stretches without speech or even sound at all.
Modern moviemaking is rife with counter-trends, reactions to once-novel ideas that have since grown tired. Take the boomlet in practical effects that succeeded years of CG overkill, or a pronounced lack of backstory following a slew of exposition-mad films.
Now the notion of talking may be getting dragged to the rubbish pile too.
“I’m a big fan of silent cinema,” director Christopher Nolan says, ""telling the story primarily pictorially and through sound and music.
""[W]hat’s exciting about movies right now,"" he adds, ""is being taken to a world you would never normally travel to in a primarily visual sense.”‎
Nolan would know. If this past summer season was a time of peak silence in film, the Brit was a key reason why. His smash World War II picture “Dunkirk” chronicled a heroic beach rescue by often using little more than the sharp images and unique sounds of conflict. Quick, name the five best lines in “Dunkirk.” The movie’s most indelible moments were sights, not speech.

Nearly a century after “The Jazz Singer” signaled the end of the silent era, dialogue-light movies are making a return, with a distinctly 21st-century spin. It’s a new and, many filmmakers say, welcome development in a medium constantly seeking fresh ideas. But the trend also raises questions about the definition of cinema in the 21st century — not least whether it could undermine one of the most treasured aspects of moviegoing.
Examples of conversational minimalism abound.‎ In Matt Reeves’ “War for the Planet of the Apes,” one of the summer’s best-reviewed films, entire scenes unfurl in silence as apes communicate via looks and sign language. The film is notable for its quiet moments, for a lack of words from man or beast.‎
In his review of ""War for the Planet of the Apes,"" Justin Chang says, ""The first thing you'll notice...is just how quiet it is. Director Matt Reeves...intuitively grasps the expressive power of silence."" The film stars and Andy Serkis, who ""brilliantly inhabits"" Ceasar, ""the soulful chimpanzee leader,"" and Woody Harrelson, in ""an unhinged but superbly controlled performance."" Video by Jason H. Neubert.

And in one of the season’s indie breakouts, David Lowery’s “A Ghost Story,” Casey Affleck’s character haunts the action by watching over his former partner Rooney Mara without saying anything. Five or 10 minutes often go by with barely a word spoken; the dialogue in the entire film could probably fit on a corner of Affleck's signature sheet.
The trend continues this fall. Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water,” an early Oscars-season front-runner after its warm reception at festivals in Venice, Telluride and Toronto, is notable because it features a mute janitor, played by Sally Hawkins, who's mainly given expression through her eyes, hands and the film’s score. ‎
Or “Wonderstruck,” Todd Haynes’ mystical October release about two deaf young people across 50 years of time. Half of the movie, set primarily in 1927 New York, plays like a silent film, with no spoken dialogue at all.

Even Angelina Jolie’s historical drama “First They Killed My Father” — a new Netflix film about the horrors of the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign in 1970s Cambodia — is characterized by its young heroine's dearth of dialogue.‎
This represents a major shift. For the past 25 years, after all, many of the best English-language movies were defined by, well, talking. Films that captivated and won honors — Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Django Unchained,"" the Sorkin-penned ""A Few Good Men"" and ""The Social Network,"" Richard Linklater's ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Boyhood,"" to name just a few — did so because of distinctive and even excessive dialogue. ‎
There was no such thing as excessive dialogue. Words were good and more words were better. The quality of a film was often judged by the crackle of its conversation; the ambition of a script could be measured by the number of its pages.
But something is changing. While a fair share of movies still attract attention for their verbal byplay, some of the best new works do so despite — or because — of no talking at all.

Directors cite a‎ number of explanations for the switch. An artistic pendulum-swing is one: If so many auteurs have been mining dialogue for so many years, maybe it's time to go another way and ratchet it down‎, they say.
Technology has also played a role. After all, it's never been this inexpensive to create high-end images.
The influence of other art forms can't be discounted either; the mainstreaming of video art, experimental cinema and other forms of imagemaking is exerting its pull.‎ In the age of emojis, it seems, sometimes you can say it better without words.
But the directors also raise social explanations — asking if in a time of cable-news blather and social-media pontification, the cinema establishment is reacting in kind. Film may be going quieter because the world has gotten noisier. Movie theaters are now a refuge from the yammering.
“It’s partially personal — I have a hard time paying attention to people talking for more than five minutes before my mind wanders,” says Lowery, who came of age idolizing Tarantino dialogue until he started making films and realized his own scenes were more powerful with less of it‎. “But I also think throughout history filmmakers respond to the world around them, use the tools at their disposal to push back.‎ And movies can be a respite from the rest of the world right now.”
Filmmakers say they increasingly realize that silence, more than just offering a moment of contrast or a simple breather, can be a device in its own right.
“The movie is in love with love and in love with cinema,” Del Toro says of the decisions he made for “The Shape of Water.” “And when you fall in love, if it’s not through song, words are entirely useless. And I thought, 'I want the connection to be in the eyes of the actor or actress and for that connection to be beyond talking.’
""What does love do? It renders you mute.”
Jolie for her part uses silence as a kind of metaphor for our collective speechlessness in the face of war’s horrors. ""Father,"" based on the harrowing memoir of the survivor ‎Loung Ung, is seen essentially from the young girl’s perspective. For much of the film the character is silently witnessing brutality, trapped in situations she can neither understand nor process.
Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who as longtime music-video directors relied on visuals for much of their careers, are back in the talking game with this weekend’s tennis drama “Battle of the Sexes.” And they’re not sure how they feel about it.
“We love great writing, but it’s a little bit of a straitjacket sometimes,” says Faris, who directed “Little Miss Sunshine” and “Ruby Sparks” with Dayton. “What we really love is interaction. And that can come in many forms.”
“When a conversation works it can move things forward,” says Dayton, ironically in constant dialogue with his wife. “But talking plot can be a bit of a burden.”
It’s understandable that for so long so many great movies would contain sharp dialogue — it’s the most fun for screenwriters, not to mention actors. But directors (some of whom, of course, also write or act) say that such thinking overlooks the joys of silence.
""My favorite [part] is we’re able to just do behavioral things,” Reeves says. “The great thing about this is that that experience is part of what people are coming to see, to submit to this very uncanny experience where they’re seeing emotions and thoughts that flicker in the eyes of apes.”
(Some modern progenitors of the trend, incidentally, include 2015’s “Mad Max: Fury Road,” which while certainly never quiet, reveled in a kind of immersive experience more than conversation, and 2012 Oscar best-picture winner “The Artist,” which rendered literal the idea of silent film.)
Many directors say that‎ while it seems tougher to write a great piece of dialogue than craft some sharp mise-en-scêne, in fact, that's a screenwriter-centric view, and doesn't consider the full trickiness of cinematography and direction.
But even if they pull it off, will audiences go for it?‎ Moviegoers are accustomed to talking, to hearing their favorite characters have a feeling they're not in Kansas anymore, of being made offers they can't refuse. What becomes of these moments in a dialogue-light future? And what becomes of the artists who traffic in that dialogue?
“It all makes me feel like an outlier even though I kind of smile to myself a little bit about it,” Sorkin says, also noting the tendency he observed among his teenage daughter and her friends to present their lives to each other via shared photos instead of text. “I can just use what I have, and that’s words.”
To be sure, movie chatter isn’t going anywhere. Even in the summer hit “Baby Driver,” where long stretches of the action are conveyed through the eyes and music-synced motions of star Ansel Elgort, filmmaker Edgar Wright crafted sharp fast talk for Kevin Spacey’s crime boss and his gang.
Meanwhile, Sorkin himself along with Linklater have movies coming this fall: the poker-world drama ""Molly's Game,” which marks Sorkin's directorial debut, and ""Last Flag Flying,"" the upcoming New York Film Festival opener in which Linklater chronicles Vietnam veterans on a fraught road trip. Both contain dense dialogue. “Molly’s Game” already received a strong reception in Toronto.
But they may be rare breeds. In a time of image-driven communication, cinema appears to be offering its own spin on the idea. Thanks to modern tools, a medium that began wordlessly is returning to its non-verbal ‎roots.‎
“Cinema lexicon has developed so that you can now push boundaries visually,” Lowery says. “You can convey many bits of information without any dialogue between characters.” Sometimes, in other words, it’s best to stop using so many of them.

'The Lego Ninjago Movie' is a few pieces short of the animated franchise's standard,"If you're of a certain age and childless, it's entirely possible you haven't the foggiest idea what a “Ninjago” — of the latest Lego movie — might be. Apparently it is both a show and a toy, but that's as far as I got into the Wikipedia listing. With the wild success of both “The Lego Movie” and “The Lego Batman Movie,” released earlier this year, it stands to reason that Warner Bros. would strike while the iron is hot and churn out more Lego-themed movies, like “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” which sadly proves that when it comes to the super-fun Lego movies, there can be diminishing returns.
The genius of “The Lego Movie” and “The Lego Batman Movie” lies in the extremely high joke density of those films, which are thick with verbal and visual gags, nearly overwhelming in their detailed specificity to both the Lego character style, and the incredibly rich worlds and mythology created around these little plastic toys. “Ninjago,” directed by Charlie Bean, Paul Fisher and Bob Logan, and credited to no fewer than nine screenwriters (including Fisher and Logan) doesn't quite maintain that level of mania that made both the original “Lego” and “Batman” deliriously fun.
Signaled by the vintage WB logo at the beginning and a live-action opening featuring Jackie Chan as a kindly shop owner telling the story of Lloyd and Ninjago to a young patron, “The Lego Ninjago Movie” is inspired by 1970s kung fu and monster movies. The young hero, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is a forlorn teenager in the seaside city of Ninjago, leading a secret double life as both the much-maligned son of villainous Garmadon (Justin Theroux) and the Green Ninja of the ninja crew that saves the city from Garmadon's destruction. Think of the ninja crew like the Power Rangers: these teens have different colors, different powers and ride around in giant animal-shaped robots fighting Garmadon and his army.
Lloyd's just a sensitive kid with daddy issues, and therefore he overcompensates a bit. During a battle, he accidentally unleashes a terrifying monster — a furry feline creature named Meow-thra (a live housecat, batting Ninjago around like a ball of yarn). With his posse of ninja buddies, under the guidance of their sensei, Mr. Liu (Chan), Lloyd sets out on an adventure to retrieve a super-special weapon to stop Meow-thra. There's just one wrinkle — his overbearing blowhard of an evil dad joins them on the trip.
“Lego Ninjago” maintains the silly and irreverent tone of the prior films, and the other ninjas are voiced with great personality by comic stars Kumail Nanjiani, Abbi Jacobson, Zach Woods, Fred Armisen, and Michael Peña.
What doesn't quite work is the emotional bonding between Lloyd and Garmadon as they get to know and accept each other, which is the heart of this tale. If the story of your film requires a lot of emotional expression, it might not work best with characters that have flat and round plastic heads and painted-on features.
Some aspects of the film are quite entertaining — Garmadon is a great character, especially as voiced by Theroux (his pronunciation of Lloyd as “Luh-Loyd” doesn't get old) — and it's a light, serviceable romp around the Legos. It just doesn't come close to the high-key antics of the first two films in the series.

Harry Styles brought thousands of teens to the Greek Theatre. We sent two adults,"Harry Styles appeared to have lost control over the top end of his vocal range Wednesday at the Greek Theatre, where this 23-year-old heartthrob from the boy band One Direction played the second date of his first tour as a solo act.
Had he gotten sick since launching the tour the night before in San Francisco? Perhaps he’d overdone it at the after-party.
Whatever the case, the slight impairment of Styles’ voice was no big deal: Screaming from the instant his pompadoured silhouette flickered across a pink curtain, the members of the singer’s very young audience provided all the high notes anyone could need.
And besides, music was hardly the thing that mattered in a concert that was all about glimpsing a dreamboat in real life.
Right?
To unpack what happened: The Times sent its resident 1D-ologists — pop music critic Mikael Wood and film writer Amy Kaufman — to the Greek on a joint assignment. Here are some of their many thoughts.
Mikael Wood: At 39, I was definitely one of the oldest people in the house, which meant I almost got a senior-citizen discount at the concession stand.  But my advanced age also allowed for some valuable context, and that was having seen One Direction a bunch of times before Harry and the rest of the band split (at least temporarily) last year.
With that in mind, what struck me was how much more musical this show was. Teen-pop stars are routinely underestimated as musicians — and their fans as listeners — and 1D always had fun with those low expectations; its happily chaotic gigs were meant to provoke people who think five guys in a band should do more onstage than just wander around and crack jokes.
Here, though, Harry was really buckling down. He played guitar reasonably well and sang complicated vocal harmonies with his four-piece band (even if he sometimes had to take the low part). And, as on his self-titled debut, the sound was rich with serious dad-rock echoes: David Bowie in “Sign of the Times,” Stealers Wheel in “Carolina,” Thin Lizzy in a reimagined take on 1D’s “Stockholm Syndrome.”
This dude even did Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain” during his encore.
I’m a dad, so obviously I didn’t mind hearing this stuff. But I kind of missed the madcap intensity of those old 1D shows, back when Harry and his mates seemed not at all concerned with demonstrating their taste or maturity.
What’d you think, Amy? Was the grown-up Harry we saw skilled but too sedate?
Amy Kaufman: First of all, I agree with you: I felt old. The friend I went to the show with was your age, and I’m 31. In an effort to fit in, I immediately purchased one of those $35 “Harry” baseball caps upon entering the venue. It is now one of my most treasured pieces of concert merchandise.
All the girls around us seemed to be between the ages of 15 and 20, and one young lady a few seats over spent the entirety of the concert in full-blown sobs. It was vaguely distracting, but it also reminded me of how intensely I felt for the boy band heroes of my youth, like Hanson and ’N Sync. Every little thing they said during a concert always felt like it was directed just to me.
On that note, I was surprised that Harry didn’t utter a word to the crowd until after the third song. Then, when he did, he really played up the flirty thing: “I am falling in love with you,” “You are the best friends any person could ask for,” “I’m pretty into you right now.” I couldn’t help but roll my eyes at some of his obvious ploys for shrieks, but the audience seemed to fall for it. 
His voice sounded amazing to me. In my opinion, he and Zayn Malik were always the most skilled vocalists in 1D, and Harry really proved that Wednesday night. But I’ll admit that I found the vibe surprisingly low-energy.
Remember after he performed “Stockholm Syndrome” — just his fourth song — and told the crowd he wished he’d saved it for later because it left him “knackered”? Maybe this was more of his charm offensive, but I was shocked. All he did was jump slightly around the stage; I didn't even see him break a sweat, and there were certainly no legitimate dance routines.
You’re 23 years old, Harry. Should we be worried about your health?
Wood: I was worried for a second when he halted “Kiwi,” which is the hardest-rocking track on “Harry Styles” — kind of a wimpy version of Jet’s wimpy version of AC/DC. Were the crunching guitars and galloping tempo too much him? Nah, he was just stopping the song to inform the crowd he needed more enthusiasm to continue.
“I’m about to tell you I’m having your baby,” he said, a delightful transgression from a guy who not so long ago was a picture of squeaky-clean puppy love.
Speaking of those early days: As eager as Harry seems to present himself as a real rocker, I liked that he didn’t disavow the 1D stuff in order to do it. Lots of people in his position would mock their boy-band pasts, but Harry actually reached back to the band’s first single, “What Makes You Beautiful.”
Granted, he and the band had overhauled it so that it sounded like Neil Diamond. But that was a savvy move, and a gracious one; it made clear that Harry doesn’t take his audience for granted.
Kaufman: He definitely does not. If anything, I thought he was almost too effusive in his thanks to his fans. I mean, he told the crowd at least four times that he wouldn’t be onstage if it weren’t for them. It was sweet, but we get it, babe.
Honestly, the whole affair was pretty syrupy, from the “Treat People With Kindness” tees he was selling to the floral suit he was wearing. I’ve always enjoyed his style; he has a more polished Mick Jagger thing going on, and he certainly pulls off a pussy-bow blouse better than Melania Trump. His hair seems to have grown back nicely since he shaved it for “Dunkirk,” though I do miss his long tresses. As my friend put it while staring fondly at him on the big video screen: “Even, like, his skull is hot.”
But I digress. Because even his looks couldn’t distract from the fact that the poor kid has only 10 songs. It did make for a tidy show, though, and it was nice to wrap up the evening by 10:15.
Eww, I really am old.
Wood: About that limited repertoire: I saw Harry play a one-off show at the Troubadour right after his album came out, and I remember thinking that, for all his fluency in this new language, he really wasn’t giving us a clear idea of who Harry Styles is. OK, so he likes the Rolling Stones. And he loves his fans. But what makes him tick? What’s he afraid of? What makes him laugh? He’s such a fuzzier presence than the old-timers he idolizes, and that hadn’t changed at the Greek.
Did you feel like Harry was expressing anything beyond his interest in ancient records?
Kaufman: Ancient? Calm down, Mikael — it’s not like he’s referencing Buddy Holly or something. But point taken: I’m not sure of his “brand,” so to speak, either. Then again, when you think about other young solo male artists of his kind — Justin Bieber, Shawn Mendes, Ed Sheeran, Charlie Puth — do you really think of a distinctive personality? I guess some of them have become known for especially revealing lyrics or bad boy behavior. Somehow, the most interesting thing we know about Harry’s personal life is that he dated Taylor Swift for a hot minute.
I’m not saying he needs to be making tabloid headlines to define his onstage persona, necessarily. I liked feeling that there was still something pure about him. I mean, the raciest thing he did all night was stick his tongue out at some chicks in the front row.
Wood: Maybe it’s that blankness that allows his fans to project their fantasies onto him.
Kaufman: I had the chance to eavesdrop on some conversations. As you might expect, most of them were totally enamored with Harry’s performance, caught in the gooey afterglow of seeing their dream boyfriend up close and personal.
“I think it’s going to dawn on me at school tomorrow, this whole night,” one teen told her friend. “Like, at soccer practice, Coach will ask what’s wrong with me, and you’ll just have to explain that I’m having a mental breakdown because of Harry.”

"'Total destruction' in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, and more rain is on the way","

Hurricane Maria is churning through the Caribbean, delivering new devastation to islands previously hit by Hurricane Irma.
Gregmarys Garcia stood atop the home she shares with her two sons, ages 5 and 3, and five other relatives. The house was surrounded by thigh-high water.
The family had stockpiled bottled water and food, packing their freezer with ice. But when Hurricane Maria hit, they lost water and, like the rest of Puerto Rico, power.
Now, in their neighborhood of Las Palmeras in San Juan, whole blocks had been turned into islands. Garcia’s block was inundated, including the family’s three cars. They relied on a neighbor’s battery-powered radio for news.
“The governor said it’s total destruction in Puerto Rico, but the worst is in the west and east,” she said.
And the worst wasn’t over.
At least 4 to 8 inches of additional rain were expected Thursday, with up to 35 inches in isolated spots, according to Mike Brennan, a specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
“That will exacerbate the ongoing flash flooding situation that's occurring over that entire island,” he said on Twitter.
Maria, the strongest storm to strike Puerto Rico in more than 80 years, reduced homes to heaps of splintered wood and crumbling concrete, turned streets into rivers of churning brown water and left the island without power.
“Typically, the rain and flooding is the principal cause of deaths,” Gov. Ricardo Rossello said during a Thursday briefing. “If you don’t have to be out in the streets, don’t.”
The full extent of the damage in Puerto Rico remained unclear, as dozens of areas were still incommunicado late Thursday. Rossello said restoring power and communication networks was a top priority, and he acknowledged the frustration of islanders unable to reach family and friends — including the governor himself.
“I haven’t been able to communicate with my parents,” he said.
Maria had moved out of the area Thursday but remained a Category 3 storm, expected to approach the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas overnight, according to the National Hurricane Center.
For several days, Maria has pummeled the Caribbean, killing dozens, including at least 15 people in Dominica, where Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said 20 more remained missing Thursday.
President Trump described Puerto Rico as “absolutely obliterated.”
“Puerto Rico is in very, very tough shape,” Trump said ahead of a meeting Thursday at the U.N. General Assembly, adding that he’s working with Rossello on the recovery.
“It’s incredible the power of that wind,” Trump said. “That was very unique. Not for many decades has a storm hit a piece of land like that.”
Trump signed a federal disaster declaration for the U.S. territory of 3.4 million people.
On Thursday weary and shellshocked residents began the long process of cleaning up.
In the oceanfront settlement of La Perla, several dozen people picked their way down rocky hillsides strewn with debris to salvage what they could from the wreckage.
At the foot of Ft. San Cristobal, just outside the walls of Old San Juan, Diego Rivera chopped at a palm tree with a machete. The fort had survived since the 1700s. All around was disorder.
Rivera, who grew up here listening to elders tell stories about the explorers who discovered and christened the area La Perla, or “The Pearl,” gestured to the mix of shingles, glass and lumber studded with rusty nails that littered the hillside under gray skies still threatening rain. Everything felt damp.
“We have to start cleaning this stuff, throw it away,” he said, adding that the government hasn’t done anything.
Rivera was clearing a path to the flooded cinder-block house where he weathered the storm. Winds tore at the metal hurricane shutters as he huddled inside, panicked. Transformers exploded outside. He tried to flee, but the downed palm tree blocked the door, leaving him trapped for about 10 hours.
The retired construction worker escaped unharmed, but his house was still full of water, the concrete ceiling crumbling. Neighboring homes of his mother, sister and niece were roofless, stripped bare by violent winds that lashed the shanties clustered above a narrow strip of beach.
Downhill, neighbors were clearing the main road. Shirtless men pushed aside stalled cars and examined ruptured water pipes as women tucked back downed power lines and swept up shattered glass.
A parking garage had collapsed on several cars. Restaurants such as Al Sabor de Sonia y Algo Mas were no longer selling mofongo and fried plantains; their doors were blocked by downed roofs. The local health center and Head Start office were covered with pieces of adjacent buildings. A sign in the park warning residents to keep the area clean had been knocked down.
Rivera said his relatives were staying in emergency hurricane shelters with hundreds of others displaced by the storm.
“All Puerto Rico is damaged,” he said, but, “we lost everything here.”
Rescues were ongoing, said Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress.
Flash-flood alerts sounded all day in the capital of San Juan, which saw spotty rain. Airports in San Juan, Aguadilla and Ponce were shut, and a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. remained in effect for the island.
Near San Juan airport, drivers struggled to make their way around flooded highways and downed trees.
Across from Garcia’s house, a few restaurants and an ATM machine were operating, with long lines. But most businesses were still shuttered, some of their windows broken by looters overnight.
Standing on a flooded street next to a park strewn with downed trees, Maribel Rodriguez said the curfew imposed by the governor was necessary. 
“It’s a good idea because yesterday it was stressful: People went right in the grocery store and took everything,” said Rodriguez, 47.
She worried about relatives elsewhere in the city, whom she couldn’t check on without phone or Internet service. Like Garcia, she depended on a neighbor’s radio for news. Her supply of food and water was already dwindling.
Her wife, who works at Chili’s restaurant, wasn’t sure when it would reopen. She held a blue barrel they had just salvaged from floodwaters and hoped to use it to collect rain.
“The government just says we have to wait 72 hours” for help, she said. Of the barrel, she said, “It’s stealing but …we need it.”
Across the island, people were banding together.
Pedro Rivera said one elderly woman with a heart condition needed medical attention after the storm. Neighbors called an ambulance, and when it wasn’t able to reach the village because of blocked roads, they helped her up the hill so she could be taken to a hospital.
Rivera pointed to a man cracking the limbs of a downed tree to clear a side street.
“It will rise again,” Rivera, 46, a cook at nearby Fresh Bistro, said of his neighborhood. “We are a village. We will raise ourselves.”
Elsewhere, 8-year-old Jovanio Lopez returned with his mother Thursday after evacuating before the storm to find their home flooded. The bathroom roof was gone.
“The house broke. Everything broke,” the third-grader said. “It stinks inside.”
They left to stay with friends, taking what they could save, including books and his game of Monopoly.
Neighbor Sonia Viruet, 61, said the government should send crews to La Perla immediately. Beside her, a neighbor in work gloves was making slow progress gathering fallen shingles.
“We need help restoring the community. First, we need help cleaning. We can try to do it ourselves, but it will take too long,” Viruet said.
Joseph Cotto took his family of six — including a 1-year-old son — to a shelter during the hurricane, but returned after the storm to help rebuild, and make space in the shelter for those in greater need.
“There are people who don’t have roofs. We wanted to make room for them. We have a house,” he said — although it, too, is damaged and without utilities.
Cotto, 31, a laborer for the city’s public works department, figured it would take at least two months to restore power and water. On Thursday, he cleared roads and hauled seawater from the bottom of the hill to run his toilet.
Angel Marcano was also cleaning up his home Thursday. Marcano, 45, who works as an aide to autistic students, was still staying at a temporary shelter at City Hall nearby, but wasn’t sure how long it would last. He also missed his La Perla neighbors, including an elderly woman across the street whom he checks on each morning.
Far down the hill near the water’s edge, neighbor Ivan Lopez helped others examine damage to their homes. It was his aunt who had to be taken to the hospital, where he said she was recovering Thursday.
Lopez, 51, survived the storm in his concrete apartment, which was relatively unscathed. The handyman planned to stay to help rebuild and said he believed the government would eventually send workers to help.
“It’s just the first day. They always come, bit by bit,” he said.
For Lopez, like many of his neighbors, evacuating La Perla was not an option.
“Here I was born,” he said, “and here I will die.”

 U.N. General Assembly live updates: 'No hope on the horizon' for war-ravaged Yemen ,"President Trump delivers his first address to the United Nations General Assembly
The annual U.N. General Assembly has generated sometimes powerful comments by world leaders on issues involving North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and the flight of minority Muslims from Myanmar as more than 100 heads of state and government gather in New York.
What's happening:
Funding for the United Nations World Food Program is substantial compared with other times in the agency's history, but more is needed to meet global needs, the agency's executive director said.
The United States is responsible for more than half the funding, David Beasley, executive director of the program, said this week during side briefings at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
“That clearly indicates that the United States is not backing down [from] the humanitarian side of international issues,"" Beasley told reporters.
Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by President Trump to head the world's largest food agency, said his first objective in assuming the position in April “was to protect U.S. funding and other major donor funding at a time period where we were facing the worst humanitarian crisis.”
Of the WFP's $3.2 billion in funding,  $1.7 billion is from the United States, Beasley said. Also of note was that funding for the WFP was passed with bipartisan support from legislators, he said.
“To see them find something that they could rally around, [something] positive … to help hungry children, it was a very significant message to the world,” Beasley said.
In July, at the Group of 20 summit in Germany, Trump pledged $639 million more in food and humanitarian assistance for fiscal year 2018 for South Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen — countries hard hit by famine.
“That was a major shift,” Beasley said. “I feel like we’ve turned a great corner in [that] America’s not going to back down. Now the president is saying the U.N. truly has a purpose. It needs to be reformed. Everyone agrees with that.”
Beasley said that even though the WFP has substantial donations, “the needs are not being met.”
“The gulf states with all of their wealth should be funding the humanitarian crisis in their region of the world: Syria, Iraq, Yemen,"" Beasley said, noting that the U.S. and Britain were among the largest donors helping Syrians, whose country remains devastated by civil war. “It’s absolutely inexcusable.”
Beasley also emphasized the need for the international community to do more to end the conflicts that have contributed to so many people being left hungry or starving. 
While President Trump was threatening to “totally destroy North Korea” this week in his address to the United Nations, the navies of Russia and China were engaged a maritime joint exercise less than 100 miles from the North Korean border with Russia.
The Russia-China exercises were the second this year and part of the so-called Joint-Sea 2017 program. The first drills in the exercise were held in the Baltic Sea in July and were closely watched by NATO and European countries, who were already on edge about Russia’s recent military muscle-flexing.
This week’s drills started in the Russian Far East port city of Vladivostok, home base of the Russian Pacific Fleet, and will continue for eight days on both land and sea. Submarine rescue and anti-submarine drills will take place in the Sea of Japan and spread into the Sea of Okhotsk, just north of Japan.
While Russia and China have been holding joint military exercises since 2012, the timing of this part of the Joint-Sea 2017 drills is significant. Washington’s rhetoric has become increasingly hostile toward the North Korean government as it has continued to disregard demands that it halt testing of nuclear weapons. Both Moscow and Beijing have significant economic interests in North Korea and have thus far had subdued responses to calls from the White House for stepped-up action against North Korea.
On Thursday, Trump announced additional economic sanctions targeting North Korea.
Russia has responded to Trump’s tough rhetoric by urging more diplomatic dialogue. Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month that pressuring North Korea with threats was “misguided and futile"" if the goal is to get North Korean President Kim Jung Un to back down.
China, North Korea’s biggest trade partner, has balked at  U.S. suggestions that it should step up  pressure on North Korean’s authoritative, hermit state to prevent a nuclear standoff.
This week, the U.S. and South Korea also held joint maritime exercises in the Pacific region, where they conducted bombing drills.
Russia and China’s exercises in the Pacific started on Sept. 18, just a few days after Russia began a massive joint military drill with neighboring Belarus called Zapad 2017 on the border between those two former Soviet states.
NATO expressed concerns about the lack of transparency from Russia about the size and scope of the exercises. Russia is a signing member of the Vienna Document, which stipulated that any member who holds exercises with more than 13,000 troops must invite other members to observe. While Russia said there were only 12,700 troops participating, Western military analysts speculated that there could be as many as 100,000, based on similar Russian military drills in the past, in which more troops showed up than originally planned.
Russia is not required by the Vienna agreement to invite international observers to military drills held east of the Ural mountains.
Significant strides have been made in halting the spread of polio and global health officials are on the verge of eradicating the crippling and potentially deadly disease — but two challenges stand in the way, according to international health officials and children’s advocates.
One is the lack of accessibility to particular areas in countries where the disease is prevalent, said Reza Hossaini, director of polio eradication at the United Nations Children’s Fund. Transmission of polio has never stopped in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan — where there are areas of conflict, insurgents have control, or infrastructure inadequacies limit access.
The other obstacle is the continued resistance of some parents to have their children vaccinated.
A lack of political commitment, religious norms and rumors about the possible effects of vaccinations, such as the belief in some Pakistani tribal areas that immunization causes male sterility, could all play a role, health officials said.
“Understanding that social dynamic, understanding what the underlying causes are is what we try to address,” said Hossaini, who spoke during a briefing to reporters on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, where the theme of discussions is “Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet.”
The UNICEF official said that during the final stages of trying to eradicate the disease, the effort has come down to literally going to each house.
“We don’t do door-to-door anymore …  we do room-to-room, because sometimes you have a silent resistance,” Hossaini said. “The parents would send the older kids, but [for] the younger kids, they would say we don't have a child at home. So yes, it still remains a challenge in a very small area.”
As recently as 30 years ago, 1,000 children were paralyzed by polio every single day, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a partnership of UNICEF, the World Health Organization, Rotary International, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 
There were only 37 reported cases of polio in 2016, according to the WHO.
Devastated by conflict, widespread cholera and the total collapse of infrastructure, Yemen has reached the precipice of a humanitarian catastrophe and there is “no hope” for resolving the crisis anytime soon.
That grim assessment of the situation in the poverty-stricken Arab nation came during media briefings this week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where the theme of discussions is “Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet.”
“The prescription for the future at the very best is bleak,” said Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N.’s resident humanitarian coordinator in Yemen. “It’s a disaster. I believe I’ll be coming back to [the U.N. General Assembly] next year with bigger numbers, and more desperate a situation … because there's nothing on the horizon that looks like it's going to go anywhere soon.”
Two years of conflict between pro-government forces and Shiite Muslim Houthi rebels have laid the groundwork for unhealthy conditions, according to humanitarian aid workers. The United States has been criticized for selling arms to Saudi Arabia, which leads an Arabian military coalition in support of Yemen’s government and has been accused of killing civilians in indiscriminate bombings.
“Civilians have borne the brunt of any pain and suffering,” McGoldrick said. “It’s one of the worst international humanitarian law violations situations. The parties to the conflict are completely indifferent to their obligations under the Geneva Conventions [rules that protect people who are not participants in the conflict].
McGoldrick painted a dire picture of conditions in the nation of 27 million people, of which about 3 million have been displaced. Among the horrifying facts: At least 7 million people don’t know when their next meal will come and what it might be. About 400,000 children under the age of 5 are acutely malnourished and every 10 minutes a child dies. Fifty percent of the health structures don’t work, while 1,700 schools don't function, 30,000 health workers have not been paid salaries and 2 million children are out of school.
“There's a lost generation,” McGoldrick said. “There's a growing radicalization in the country because of absence of governance, absence of security.”
The country’s cancer center has closed, McGoldrick added. The blood banks are under pressure. Dialysis is no longer available because the machines don’t work. Treatment is lacking for diabetics.
“And all of that is having an impact on an already weakened population,” the humanitarian official said. Throughout the country, “people are dying … silent deaths,” he said.
Exacerbating the death toll is the Saudi-led coalition’s halt of all commercial traffic in and out of the international airport in the country’s capital, Sana.
As many as 10,000 Yemenis are reported to have died from critical health conditions because they could no longer travel overseas for medical treatment, according to international media reports citing local government data.
“There’s no hope on the horizon right now politically,” McGoldrick said. “So the result of that is there’s no hope on the horizon for the humanitarian situation, because we cannot solve this problem. This is a political problem.""
Taiwan has its own military, currency and immigration controls. Despite these hallmarks of nationhood, the island of 23 million people cannot join the United Nations or observe the events of U.N. organizations.
After more than 10 years of trying, Taiwan has run out of applications to get inside the United Nations itself, the U.N.-backed World Health Assembly, its climate control convention and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
All applications are dead, a Taiwanese Foreign Ministry publicist said Wednesday.
China, a veto-power-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council, doesn’t want Taiwan in. Beijing views Taiwan not as a country but as part of Chinese territory. Taiwan’s legal government, the Republic of China, fled to the island after losing the Chinese civil war in the 1940s to the Communists who now rule Beijing.
Taiwan left the United Nations in 1971 as China entered, welcomed by other members for its vast population and fast-growing economy. China now has more than 170 foreign allies. Taiwan has 20.
“Why bang your head against the door again and again without any hope that it will open?” asked Coen Blaauw, executive director of the Washington-based Taiwan advocacy group Formosan Assn. for Public Affairs.
Taiwanese people want more recognition for their economy, the world’s 22nd largest, according to the International Monetary Fund, and humanitarian work overseas even in countries that don’t recognize it diplomatically. Officials in Taipei hope to get U.N. data first-hand.
“It is obvious that Taiwan's exclusion from the meetings of several of the U.N.'s specialized agencies both delays Taiwan's access to critical information and deprives the international community of contributions that Taiwan can make,” said Alan Romberg, East Asia Program director with American think tank the Stimson Center.
“The U.S. and others seek to fill the gaps for Taipei by acting as a conduit, but this cannot be a fully adequate substitute,” he said.
Three successive Taiwanese presidents have asked sympathetic U.N. member states to lobby for letting it in outright or observe sub-agencies.
Under Taiwan's past president, Ma Ying-jeou, China in effect allowed Taiwan to observe annual World Health Organization assemblies, officials on the island said then, because Ma had set aside political disputes with Beijing in order to hatch an unprecedented dialogue between the two governments. Current President Tsai Ing-wen has angered China by declining to see the two sides as part of one country.
Taiwan lost its WHO assembly observer status in May. After Tsai took office, the government last year applied for permission to participate in that group, the aviation body and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.
As the United Nations opened its 72nd General Assembly session Sept. 12 in New York, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying its diplomatic allies on the inside had urged U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to see Taiwan’s point and “solve the problem” of its non-access.
Last week the 6,000-member, Taipei-based civic group Taiwan United Nations Alliance emailed all 193 U.N. members with a letter saying Taiwan’s people should not be excluded since 80% of the population is “longing to be a new member,” alliance President Michael Tsai said.
The alliance drew 1,000 people to a demonstration Saturday in Washington.
The Taiwanese government, he said, should “stand up firmly” and apply for U.N. membership by writing its own letter to the secretary-general.
If Japan has any qualms about President Trump’s confrontational rhetoric toward North Korea, its leader isn’t letting on.
“We consistently support the stance of the United States that all options are on the table,” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, five days after North Korea sent a ballistic missile streaking above the Japanese archipelago — the second such overflight in less than three weeks.
Abe, speaking a day after Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend the United States or its allies, declared that the North’s mercurial leader, Kim Jong Un, is a greater menace than ever.
“The gravity of this threat is unprecedented,” Abe told the world body. “It is indisputably a matter of urgency.”
He said Kim had a tendency to “dismiss with a smirk” outside efforts to rein in the North’s nuclear and missile programs, and cited the North’s history of “deceiving us and buying time.”  
“It was absolutely not a lack of dialogue that gave rise to this situation,” Abe said in remarks devoted almost entirely to the North Korean threat.
Calling for international solidarity, the Japanese leader warned that “there is not much time left” to defuse the North Korean threat.
Kim has singled out U.S. ally Japan for frequent apocalyptic threats. Last week, North Korea threatened to ""sink"" the Japanese islands, saying Japan ""no longer needed to exist near us.""
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that “Israel is not interested” in achieving peace.
“A commitment to peace by one side is not enough,” said Abbas, who listed various peace blueprints put together over the decades and accused Israel of sabotaging them all.  
The Palestinian leader spoke a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the world body. In his speech, Netanyahu made only a brief reference to hopes for peace with all of Israel’s Arab neighbors in the region, including the Palestinians.
In his address to the chamber, the 82-year-old Palestinian leader declared that “the two-state solution is in jeopardy,” referring to the aim, long supported by Washington, for Israel and a Palestinian state to exist side by side. President Trump has been more equivocal than predecessors about such a scenario, though senior aides say it remains the U.S. goal.
Abbas also suggested that Israel was seeking to ignite a “religious war” with repeated provocations over a disputed holy site in Jerusalem’s Old City, and denounced Jewish settlement-building activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, saying “Israel builds wherever it wishes.”
Trump has spoken frequently and enthusiastically about prospects for Mideast peace, putting his son-in-law Jared Kushner in charge of an effort to bring the two sides to the table, but if anything, the two sides' positions have hardened since the U.S. president took office.
Earlier Wednesday, Trump met with Abbas on the sidelines of the General Assembly, telling reporters as the two headed into their talks that “I think we have a very, very good chance” for achieving peace.
“Complex subject, always been considered the toughest deal of all,” Trump said, adding, “I think we have a pretty good shot, maybe the best shot ever.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, addressing the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, sharply questioned President Trump’s authority to single-handedly scrap the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear accord, saying the pact “belongs to the international community in its entirety, and not only to one or two” governments.
“It would be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,” the Iranian president said, an apparent reference to Trump’s repeated hints —  including one delivered at the world body a day earlier — that he was poised to tear up the accord, which was negotiated between six world powers and Iran.
Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had made a decision about the pact, but did not disclose it.
Rouhani, together with then-President Obama, was a chief architect of the accord.
The speech was laced with direct and indirect denunciations of Trump, who a day earlier had referred to Iran as a ""rogue nation."" Without mentioning Trump by name, the Iranian leader decried “ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric” delivered in the chamber a day earlier. He singled out “the new U.S. administration” in saying it would destroy its own credibility by abrogating international agreements.
The 2-year-old nuclear agreement, negotiated by the United States, the European Union and other partners, led to the lifting of most international sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
Rouhani, who won a second presidential term earlier this year, said Iran would not be the first to violate the agreement, but that it would take unspecified steps if others did so.
“We never threaten anyone, but we do not tolerate threats from anyone,” he said. “We believe in dialogue based on equal footing and mutual respect.”
President Trump said Wednesday he has made a decision on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal - but didn't say if he would scrap the landmark agreement or stay in it. 
""I have decided,"" Trump repeated three times in response to shouted questions from reporters. When pressed on what specifically he decided, Trump smiled and said, ""I'll let you know.""
By his cryptic response, Trump seemed to be bringing to global diplomacy his penchant for building suspense honed during years as a reality television star. Yet as recently as Tuesday, administration officials were still preparing options for him to consider before an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying Iran's compliance with the agreement to block its work toward nuclear weaponry.
Trump made the comments as he sat down to talk with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the Lotte Palace Hotel in New York City.
Trump also is meeting Wednesday with leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the United Kingdom as the United Nations General Assembly continues to meet a few blocks away.
Trump has not hidden his disdain for the Iran deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration along with England, France, Russia, China and Germany. As a candidate and since, he vowed to abandon the agreement.
Under its terms, Iran agreed to destroy or dismantle its nuclear development infrastructure in exchange for easing international sanctions.
In his first speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump called the accord ""an embarrassment"" for the United States and hinted he would revisit it. 
""I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it, believe me,” Trump said, adding that the U.S. ""cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.""
The U.N. Security Council endorsed the deal two years ago, and the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has repeatedly concluded that Tehran is complying with its obligations under the accord. So has Trump, twice, since he took office.
Several of Trump's close advisors have tried to convince him to stay in the deal for the next few months to give them time to work with allies to toughen some terms of the agreement. 
French President Emmanuel Macron in particular has been working with other European leaders behind the scenes on adding additional measures.
On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Iran is in ""technical compliance"" with the agreement, but said it has violated the spirit of its preamble by continuing to support terrorism and building ballistic missiles.
The U.S. has maintained sanctions on Iran related to those concerns, however. 
Under U.S. law, the Trump administration faces an Oct. 15 deadline to inform Congress that Iran following the terms of the nuclear deal.
If Trump won't certify Iran is complying, Congress will have 60 days to decide if sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program should be put back in place, an action that would effectively scrap the U.S. side of the deal.
Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday in a speech that praised U.S. plans to send thousands more troops to the country in the long-standing fight against terrorism. 
Ghani said that 16 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which resulted in a U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, violence by terrorist groups remained a substantial threat in the country.
""Driven by transnational terrorist networks, criminal organizations, cyber crime and state sponsorship of terror,"" the violence ""promises to be a decade-long threat to national security rather than a passing phenomenon,"" he said.
Ghani, who was elected president in 2014, has focused on bringing stability to his country and combating militant groups such as the Taliban. 
President Trump last month announced a new strategy that includes sending 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan, in addition to about 8,400 U.S. and 5,000 North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops there advising Afghan security forces.
""With President Trump's recent announcement of his strategy to counter terrorism and bring stability to South Asia, Afghanistan's enduring partnership with the U.S. has been renewed and redirected,"" Ghani said. 
Congress authorized the war in Afghanistan after the 2001 attacks. 
Before becoming president, Trump denounced the war, calling it a ""terrible mistake"" and tweeting in 2013 that ""we should leave Afghanistan immediately."" 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had little to say about prospects for peace with the Palestinians — but plenty to say about the Iran nuclear accord, which he vehemently opposes.
Netanyahu, addressing the General Assembly on its opening day Tuesday, called Iran’s nuclear ambitions a “dark shadow” and said its rulers “vow to destroy my country.” That echoed rhetoric employed a short time earlier by President Trump, who called Iran’s government a “reckless regime” and suggested the landmark 2015 accord would be revisited.
Calling yet again for the scrapping of the pact between Iran and six world powers, Netanyahu said the nuclear deal “doesn’t block Iran’s path to the bomb, but actually paves it.”
“Change it, or cancel it. Fix it, or nix it,” the Israeli leader challenged. “Nixing the deal means restoring massive pressure on Iran, including crippling sanctions, until Iran fully dismantles its nuclear weapons capability.”
After discussing the Iranian nuclear accord at length, Netanyahu did refer briefly to Israel’s hopes for “peace with all our Arab neighbors, including the Palestinians.”
He said he considered Trump an ally in that effort, adding: “Together we can seize the opportunities for peace, and together we can confront the great dangers of Iran.”
Netanyahu has made clear he does not consider the General Assembly a forum friendly to Israel, and he was critical of actions including last December’s Security Council resolution condemning Jewish settlement-building.
Immediately before the Israeli leader spoke, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the Palestinian question the “gaping wound of the world” and called for a halt to settlement activity.
In a pointed rejection of President Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy, French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday urged world leaders to join together to confront global challenges, including war, terrorism, immigration and climate change.
“Today, more than ever, we need multilateralism,” Macron said in his maiden address to the United Nations General Assembly. “Why? Because our challenges are global.”
Macron said he “profoundly respects” Trump’s decision to withdraw from a landmark agreement reached in Paris in 2015 to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But although he said the deal could be improved, he emphasized, “This accord will not be renegotiated.”
“The future of the world is that of our planet, which is in the process of taking its revenge against the foolishness of men,” he said, referring to recent hurricanes that brought devastation to parts of the Caribbean, Texas and Florida.
Macron’s appeal for collective action and dialogue between nations was in sharp contrast to a speech delivered by Trump, in which he decried a landmark nuclear disarmament deal reached with Iran in 2015 as “an embarrassment to the United States” and threatened North Korea with “total destruction.”
North Korea’s recent nuclear and missile tests present the world with an “existential” threat, Macron said. “Our responsibility, with all our partners, including China, is to bring it back to the negotiating table.”
Macron hailed the agreement reached between Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., as a “solid, robust and verifiable” way to ensure  the Islamic Republic does not also arm itself with nuclear weapons.
“To denounce it would be a grave error,” he said. “Because it is a good deal, essential to peace at a time where the risk of an infernal spiral cannot be excluded.”
“Global Estimates of Modern Slavery,” a new report by the Walk Free Foundation and the International Labor Organization, says 89 million people experienced some form of slavery in the last five years.
The report, published Tuesday, said an estimated 25.9 million men, women and children were forced to work against their will in 2016.
“Today, women and girls are predominantly being subjected to forced labor in domestic work and the sex industry, whereas men and boys are being subjected to forced labor in construction, in manufacturing and in fishing,” said Fiona David, the Walk Free Foundation’s executive director of global research. The foundation is working to end slavery and human trafficking.
Also, the report said 15.4 million people were confined to a marriage to which they had not consented. Most of the enslaved are women and girls, who make up 71% of the overall total of enslaved people.
The report demonstrates the challenges of achieving the United Nations’ goal of combating forced labor, modern slavery and human trafficking in all its forms by 2025. The report examines different forms of forced labor, which it said occurred in every region of the world in 2016.
The core statistics were based on national surveys involving interviews with more than 71,000 respondents across 48 countries, researchers said. It was supplemented with data from the International Organization for Migration. The report warned the numbers were conservative estimates due to the limitations of the data.

The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
READ TRUMP'S FULL REMARKS>>
The North Korean ambassador to the United Nations walked out just before President Trump’s speech, so there was no immediate read-out on what he or his ultimate boss, Kim Jong Un, might have thought of the nickname “Rocket man,’’ or the warning that the United States might have to “totally destroy North Korea.’’
But North Korea watchers who have proven adept in the past at channeling the reactions of the Pyongyang regime expect a suitably incendiary response.
“Holy cow,’’ said Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst who has been following the country for two decades. “If I were Kim Jong Un, I’d think, I better accelerate this thing and finish building my nuclear weapon before it’s too late. These threats will only increase the hysteria and paranoia in North Korea.’’
 “They will threaten to destroy him [Trump] in language even more colorful than he could muster,’’ predicted Michael J. Green, a former Asia advisor to President George W. Bush. Green said, however, that Trump was right in taking a hard line to warn North Korea that the United States will not tolerate any belligerence towards its allies, South Korea and Japan.
Bruce W. Bennett of the Rand Corporation said Trump’s warning, although blunt, did not differ in substance from what has been the U.S. policy for decades. “The U.S. has always said that if it needs to defend itself or its allies against North Korean aggression, the regime will be destroyed,’’ said Bennett. “I think Trump needed to be very explicit with them.""
Repeated telephone calls to the North Korean mission to the U.N. went unanswered Tuesday morning. Ambassador Ja Song Nam was seen leaving the room before Trump arrived to speak, leaving only a junior diplomat as a representative. NBC news reporters said they were told he left in order to “boycott” the speech.
 
The governing theme of President Trump's speech to the United Nations General Assembly could be summed up in one word: sovereignty.
In a 42-minute speech, ""sovereign"" and its variations appeared 21 times, most frequently in the opening and closing parts of the address.
Trump clearly rejected the emphasis that his predecessor, Barack Obama, and other Democrats have put on international institutions and multiparty agreements that restrain national sovereignty.
""The nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition,"" he declared -- a sentiment that many internationalists would dispute.
""Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity and peace for themselves and for the world,"" he said.
At the same time, as several analysts noted, Trump's respect for the sovereign decisions of independent nations did not extend to the three countries that he singled out for the most criticism -- Iran, Venezuela and North Korea -- which he threatened to ""totally destroy"" if they force the U.S. to ""defend itself or its allies.""
Those countries, Trump put in a separate category of ""rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based.""
""They respect neither their own citizens, nor the sovereign rights of other countries,"" Trump said, suggesting that, as a result, they had forfeited their own sovereign rights. 
Human Rights Watch on Tuesday called for the U.N. General Assembly to condemn the Myanmar military campaign against the country’s Rohingya Muslim population and urged the U.N. Security Council to impose sanctions and an arms embargo against the army.
More than 400,000 Rohingya have escaped Myanmar, also known as Burma, into Bangladesh since the military responded to an Aug. 25 insurgent attack by carrying out deadly operations in the western state of Rakhine, human rights groups said. The military has shot civilians as they fled and burned Rohingya villages to the ground.
The situation in Myanmar, a mostly Buddhist country, has generated criticism of the governing party’s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who addressed the crisis publicly for the first time Tuesday in a nationally televised speech from the capital, Naypyitaw. She said the government wanted to find out why the exodus was happening.
Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient who led the opposition to the nation’s former military leaders, also defended the military and accused the international community of overlooking other challenges facing the country.
The government views members of the ethnic and religious minority as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and not among the dozens of national ethnicities officially recognized by Myanmar. Rohingya activists say many families have lived in Myanmar for years.
The U.N. General Assembly is meeting in New York this week. 
President Trump, who dismissed the United Nations as feckless and worthless during his campaign, offered measured praise for the institution during his debut speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday, even as he complained that the United States was bearing too much of the cost.
“The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22% of the budget and more,” Trump said. “The United States bears an unfair cost burden.”
Yet he thanked U.N. Secretary General António Guterres “for recognizing that the United Nations must reform,” and singled out for praise efforts led by the U.S. to combat AIDS and malaria and to help empower women around the world.
The dual message suggested that Trump still sees a role for the international body, though a lesser one than either of his predecessors, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Trump said that “the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” 
“This is the beautiful vision of this institution. And this is the foundation for cooperation and success,” he explained. “Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.”
President Trump told the global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that ""major portions of the world are in conflict, and some, in fact, are going to hell.""
It was one of the most dramatic lines in a 40-minute address in which Trump called for a ""great reawakening of nations.""
It was also an example of the challenge in the foreign policy approach Trump laid out, at once tolerant of other nations pursuing their own interests without judgments yet sharply critical of Venezuela and other regimes Trump opposes.
“We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example,"" Trump said early on, as he emphasized the sovereignty of nations.
He said he did not expect other countries to share in America's traditions, values or way of life. He said he expected foreign leaders to mirror his ""America First"" policy of pursuing their own interests ahead of international goals, as long as they peacefully coexisted.
Yet in the second half of his speech, he spoke out sharply against North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba, in part for how they treat their own citizens and behave in the world. 
“America stands for every person living in a brutal regime,” Trump said.
He called for “full restoration of democracy and political freedom in Venezuela.”

The Republican tax plan is still more talk than action,"They have a blueprint and principles. They’ve held countless strategy sessions for what could be the biggest tax overhaul in decades.
They even produced a handy desk calendar with daily inspirational messages and helpful tax statistics to drive home the need for reform.
All Republicans need now is an actual plan.
Despite months of promises and what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calls a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” the GOP-led Congress and White House have yet to agree on how to revamp the tax code, including how much to reduce corporate and individual tax rates, how tax cuts would be paid for or whether they will be offset at all.
“There is no movement on tax reform,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, after Republicans huddled recently behind closed doors for the latest update.
“I’m sure they’re working, paddling like a bunch of ducks,” he said. “They just need to make some decisions.”
Next week, Republicans are set to unveil a “consensus document,” which they say will be a much more detailed overview than previous policy papers. But despite some earlier hopes, it is not expected to be an actual plan or bill.
Instead, House Republicans will huddle at a private GOP retreat next week to review the latest offering and consider next steps as Congress tries to pass a bill by the end of the year.
But blueprints and drafts are far from legislation. A key problem for Republicans remains the division within their majority between fiscal hawks who insist that any tax cut not add to the deficit and those who are willing to risk ballooning the debt in hopes that it will spur enough economic growth to cover the price tag.
Key Senate Republicans, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), announced this week a deal to proceed with a package that would add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the deficit, an extraordinary pivot for a party that has prided itself on fiscal conservatism.
But officials said Thursday that figure remains in flux. And their accord is no guarantee of broader support for the final tax bill.
“This is really the heart and soul of who the Republican Party is,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group.
“Republicans have been fighting to have control of the House, the Senate and the White House to make some improvements to the fiscal situation, and they are on track to do absolutely the opposite,” she said.
Trump is another wild card. Cutting the deficit or debt was never one of his top priorities. And restless with the Republican logjam in Congress, Trump has signaled a willingness to court the minority party for a fresh approach, as he did recently with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer to reach deals on immigration and the debt ceiling.
Though earlier GOP tax proposals would have benefited mostly corporations and the rich, Trump more recently has said his focus will be on the middle class.
“The wealthiest Americans are not my priority,” Trump said recently. “My priority are people in the middle class, and that’s where we’re giving the big tax reduction to.”
Overhauling the tax code is no easy task, and the last time Congress was able to accomplish a big tax deal was in 1986, an effort so difficult and complicated entire books have been written about it.
Republicans are determined, even desperate, to fulfill their campaign pledge on tax reform.
“The stakes are higher than ever that we deliver,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, told GOP colleagues during a private meeting last week.
Trump has made clear his preference for a massive corporate tax cut — dropping the rate from 35% to 15% — which is even too low for some of the most conservative Republicans who worry it would pile on to the nation’s debt. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has aimed closer to a 20% rate.
Republicans also want to consolidate individual rates into fewer brackets, and Trump — in what many saw as a nod to Democrats — said recently that the wealthiest Americans may actually have to pay more.
But how to pay for everything remains the problem.
Initially, Ryan had proposed the so-called border-adjustment tax on foreign-made goods, potentially providing a windfall of $1 trillion in new revenue that could offset sweeping cuts.
But that idea was abandoned by the White House after fierce opposition from groups aligned with the powerful Koch brothers and other businesses groups.
That left Republicans scrambling to agree on an assortment of deductions to offset some of the costs, aiming particularly at Democratic-leaning states with proposals to cap mortgage interest deductions for loans above $500,000, for example, which would particularly hit expensive real estate markets in California and New York.
They also have discussed limiting the ability to write off state income taxes, which also would hit hardest in high-cost, liberal-leaning states.
But such steps would not be enough to pay for everything, piling onto deficits. Roughly speaking, every percentage-point reduction in the corporate tax rate costs about $100 billion over a decade, putting the price tag for Trump’s 15% corporate rate at about $2 trillion.
Pelosi derides the GOP reliance on hoped-for growth to cover tax cuts as a “warmed over stew” of trickle-down economics that does little to help lower- and middle-income working Americans and their families.
“To take corporate America down to 15 is like, what are we talking about here?” Pelosi said.
She encouraged the White House and its Republican allies in Congress to do a better job studying the budget — “it’s like your irregular verbs,” she said — to better understand what is at stake if they eliminate so much tax revenue.
“He wants America to be No. 1. You can’t be No. 1 if you’re not investing in education, science and technology and all the things our budget is committed to doing.”
Republicans are under great pressure from their allies in the business community to make progress on their plan, which is being crafted under special budget rules that allow for simple majority passage, bypassing a Senate filibuster that would otherwise require 60 votes.
“If you have the White House and you have both sides of Congress, and you can’t get tax reform done, it is an indictment of them, and I would say business leadership as well,” Randall Stephenson, chief executive of AT&T Inc., said at a forum hosted by the Business Roundtable, a trade association of CEOs of the largest U.S. corporations.
But if Republicans are unable to create consensus among themselves, Trump may be inclined to try again with Democrats.
One centrist Republican, Rep. Tom Reed of New York, was among a dozen lawmakers from both parties who met with Trump recently at the White House to discuss ideas going forward.
“At the end of the day, there’s a clear indication that, look, we’ve tried to go one way,” Reed said. “It hasn’t worked. They’re not going to be beholden to that way any longer. They’re open to getting things done.”

"In Alabama, the heart of Trump country, many think he's backing the wrong candidate in Senate race","President Trump will swoop into Alabama on Friday to bolster the campaign of Sen. Luther Strange, a soft-spoken former state attorney general now in danger of losing the seat he was tapped to fill just months ago after Jeff Sessions joined the administration.
But in this conservative state that overwhelmingly supported Trump and prides itself as the heart of Old Dixie, some think the president is backing the wrong man. And they’re not sure his visit will help.
Voter enthusiasm instead runs high for the more Trump-like candidate, Roy Moore, the state’s polarizing former chief justice. His far-right, Bible-quoting views twice resulted in him being forced off the bench for defying higher court decisions, including the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of gay marriage. Die-hard supporters have no doubt he will be just as unwavering if they send him to Washington.
The GOP establishment has poured millions of dollars into Strange’s campaign, much from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s aligned Senate Leadership Fund.
But a rival group, run by allies of Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump advisor, backs Moore, turning Tuesday’s GOP runoff into a trial run for several upcoming outsider-versus-establishment contests to be waged in Arizona, Nevada and other states ahead of the 2018 midterm election.
The race also marks a new kind of power struggle for the hearts and minds of Trump voters — one that pits Bannon, an influential figure in the president’s campaign, against Trump himself.
Trump’s endorsement was once seen as making Strange a shoo-in for the job. But now it’s unclear whether voter loyalty to the president can overcome skepticism about “Big Luther,” as Alabamans call the 6-foot-9 senator.
“I was a big Trump supporter -- and still am -- but he's wrong on this one,” said Jeff Hopper, a gun rights activist who brought his family to hear Moore speak at a Christian high school in Florence, Ala., where cotton grows in fields along the highway.
“Quite frankly I’m a little bit disappointed that Donald Trump has decided to come out on his side.”
Despite Trump’s endorsement, which Strange has made a central part of his campaign, many voters here view him as an uninspiring mainstream politician being forced on them by McConnell and others.
It didn’t help that Strange was appointed by former Gov. Robert Bentley, who at the time was embroiled in an ethics scandal that many believed Strange’s public integrity unit was investigating. Bentley avoided impeachment by resigning soon after Strange’s appointment.
The temporary appointment to Sessions’ old Senate seat was intended to give Strange a head start in the race. Instead it has tarnished his image.
Moore, on the other hand, appeals to Bannon’s preference for disrupters like Trump. Now that Bannon has left the White House and resumed his war on the Washington establishment at the Breitbart News website, helping Moore also gives Bannon another opportunity to frustrate McConnell and other GOP leaders. Bannon and Moore met recently in Washington.
“This is a real opportunity to set the tone for the Trump coalition of candidates,” said Eric Beach, a GOP operative from California who runs the pro-Trump Great America Alliance and its PAC.
The group recently hired a top Bannon aide as a senior advisor and is running TV ads supporting Moore and bashing Strange. It is launching a Sarah Palin-headlined bus tour ahead of Tuesday’s vote.
Strategists say the bruising battle may create an opening for Democrat Doug Jones, the former U.S. attorney in Birmingham, who reinvestigated the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963 and won convictions against two former Ku Klux Klan members decades after that pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. It would be a stunning turn of events in red-state Alabama.


Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has sought a variety of documents related to President Trump’s tenure in the White House, the president’s attorney, John Dowd, has confirmed.


The inquiry from Mueller, the former FBI director who is heading the investigation of Russian election meddling and...
“Anything’s possible,” said Sen. Richard C. Shelby, who was the state’s last Democrat elected to the Senate in 1992 before he switched to the Republican Party.
At a Saturday morning meeting of the Baldwin County GOP, just across the bay from the faded charm of downtown Mobile, Strange dutifully checked the boxes of his resume – his work as lead counsel for the Gulf states after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and creating a public integrity unit that toppled Alabama leaders.
Strange is warm and chatty on a personal level, but as a candidate he’s sometimes what Trump himself might mock as “low-energy,” particularly in comparison to the firebrand Moore. He’s more passionate talking about his grandkids than discussing his support of legislation to make it easier to purchase firearm silencers.
Trump’s blessing is now seen as Strange’s main hope of winning, though recent polling shows the race has narrowed amid attack ads on Moore about the handling of funds related to a religious-liberties charity he ran.
“I cannot be more proud of the endorsement of our president,” Strange told the small crowd. “Every time I see him he asks about how are my great friends in Mobile doing?... He just loves Alabama, wants us to be successful.”
In a tweet Wednesday, Trump said he looked forward to Friday’s rally and added, “I am supporting ‘Big’ Luther Strange because he was so loyal & helpful to me!”
Strange said backlash over his appointment comes mainly from allies of elected officials that his public corruption unit booted from office.
“Clearly there was no impropriety any way, and the facts just kind of speak for themselves,” he said in an interview.
Where Strange has often failed to excite voters, Moore has proved too controversial for many. For some Republicans, almost anyone would be better than Moore.
“I go back to that line in the movie with Marlon Brando on the ship: ‘Let’s just throw the Bible-thumping SOB overboard,’” said Dan Benton, 78, a retired lawyer in Fairhope.
At Moore’s Florence rally, the former judge outlined all the wrongs he sees in Washington and “spiritual wickedness in high places.” He warned of “the awful calamity of abortion and sodomy and perverse behavior and murders and shootings and road rage” as “a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins.”
In response to a question from one of the only African Americans in the audience — who asked when Moore thought America was last “great” -- Moore acknowledged the nation’s history of racial divisions, but said: “I think it was great at the time when families were united -- even though we had slavery -- they cared for one another…. Our families were strong, our country had a direction.”
At the same event, Moore referred to Native Americans and Asian Americans as “reds and yellows,” and earlier this year he suggested the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were divine punishment.
Moore tends to prefer his interpretation of Christian Scripture to laws and court orders, which has twice put him out of a job for defying federal court rulings.
It’s a popular stance among some voters. After Moore was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 for refusing to abide by a federal order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from a state courthouse, voters elected him chief justice again in 2012. Then he was suspended for defying the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage and resigned.
“If they can make it between two men, they can make it between five men,” he reasoned Sunday.
Jim and Anne Bevis, semiretired ministers, see Moore’s rise as another example of a “silent majority” bucking the establishment, just the way they viewed Trump.
“We trust him,” agreed Angela Broyles, who runs a small publishing house.
Some forgive Trump’s endorsement and hope he’ll change his mind. But that does not appear likely.
Democrats predict the bitter GOP primary, fueled by vicious ad campaigns funded by outside groups, will work in their favor in the December general election.
“Our campaign is right on track,” Jones said in an interview at his campaign headquarters in Birmingham. “As people have seen what has happened in this state, I think they want someone who is not going to embarrass them.”
Moore, though, sees his race as the start of a revival in GOP politics.
“People ask, ‘Well, if you go to Congress are you going to say these things?’” he said. “If I go to Congress why wouldn’t I say these things? … If they don’t want that in Washington, then they better not get me up there.”

"After Hurricane Maria, 'Puerto Rico isn’t going to be the same'","Hurricane Maria left a historic trail of destruction across Puerto Rico on Wednesday, its powerful winds carving holes in the walls of 300-year-old homes, flooding neighborhoods, sucking metal roofs off buildings, downing 100-year-old trees and leaving the entire island without power.

In the capital of San Juan, volunteers sprang into action, assisting stranded drivers, cutting and removing downed limbs to clear the roads. Looters also took advantage of the chaos following the storm to break into furniture stores and gas stations, running past a San Juan police car with sofas and chairs. The police car did not appear to stop.
Maria made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane packing 155-mph winds — just 2 mph short of Category 5 status — near the southern city of Yabucoa. But by Wednesday afternoon, the storm had been downgraded to a Category 2, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was continuing its westward march toward the Dominican Republic.
Throughout Puerto Rico — from San Juan to rural towns — roads turned into raging rivers, and social media showed people wading through chest-high water to safety. Trees that had survived innumerable storms snapped in half in the howling winds. Palm trees, stripped of their fronds, looked like matchsticks.
“Puerto Rico isn’t going to be the same,” said Migdalia Caratini, a lawyer who lives east of San Juan. “It’s going to be before Maria and after Maria.”
The island was already reeling from Hurricane Irma, which passed the northern coast of Puerto Rico last week as a Category 5. Though Puerto Rico escaped a direct hit from Irma, the storm inflicted major damage on the electrical grid, and portions of the island had been without power even before Maria made landfall.
On Wednesday, officials from the Puerto Rico State Agency for Emergency and Disaster Management said that portions of the island could be without power for several weeks.
More than 500 people evacuated to the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in the capital, where pieces of the roof began to give way and leak at the height of the storm early Wednesday. As winds howled outside, Lydia Gonzalez said she watched in horror as the roof stretched and strained ""like bubble gum."" But it held.
""This roof was like a miracle. We heard the hurricane and thought we would see it"" come apart, she said.
The winds died down briefly, and staffers moved most of the evacuees to halls on the second floor.
Gonzalez and dozens of others had to stay on cots in the dark, flooded first floor hallways because they could not handle the stairs. Gonzalez is elderly, and was caring for her 94-year-old mother, who lay on a cot, complaining of thirst. Gonzalez didn't want to give her too much water because then she would have to use the bathrooms, she said, which had not been cleaned, and the stench reached where her mother lay in the hall.
The power had gone out overnight, along with the air conditioning, and the humidity left the walls damp. Other elderly and disabled evacuees sat nearby in the darkened hall in wheelchairs. At least one lay on a stretcher.
Gonzalez, who retired from working for a local electric company, has relatives in Florida, Maryland and North Carolina, but her mother couldn't handle the plane ride and refused to leave behind their sixth-floor apartment, which they had been told to evacuate. They had stayed home during Hurricane Irma, but had to move afterward to a hotel for a week because they couldn't endure the heat without power. Gonzalez expects they and many others may be stranded for days again.
Another evacuee at the coliseum, Josefina Bayes de la Paz, said her home flooded after a nearby river overflowed its banks. She was already working only two days a week as a cleaner before the storm, earning $138. Now, with people struggling to get by without power, she didn't expect to find any work. 
""The poor people are hungry,"" she said. ""Workers need direct help."" 
Bayes has a daughter on the U.S. mainland, but couldn't ask her for help: She lives in Houston, and lost her own house to flooding during Hurricane Harvey.
Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, in a statement, called for calm and “prudence during these difficult days.” Citing the need to maintain public order, Rossello imposed a curfew for the island from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. that will be in effect until Saturday. As night fell, most buildings in San Juan were dark, though some had generators to provide power.
During the day, volunteers did what they could to restore order. Reynaldo Rosa, 36, was among those who stopped to remove trees from a highway in San Juan so cars could pass before dark. Rosa had stopped even though he was in a hurry: The story blew out the windows in his apartment, which was now flooded. 
Rosa was trying to reach a friend's house, where he planned to shelter with his wife, Mairis Cassagnol, 33, and their poodle, Taize. ""We're trying to find a safe place,"" said Cassagnol, who, like her husband, works for the government and did not expect government offices to reopen soon.
Another San Juan resident, Solimar Quinones, survived Hurricane Maria relatively unscathed: Water seeped into the historic row house she shares with her partner in Old San Juan, but they mopped it up and were listening to a battery-operated radio by Wednesday afternoon. Quinones, 33, works as a librarian at a local school, her partner at a dot-com startup. 
A woman passed their open window and called out to see how the couple had fared during the storm. Fine, they said. ""That's a tourist from Mexico, and she's worried about us,"" Quinones said — despite the devastating earthquake in Mexico.
Maria was the third major storm, after Harvey and Irma, to form in the Atlantic in recent weeks and reach Category 5 status. 
On Monday night it raked the island of Dominica in the eastern Caribbean with sustained winds of 160 mph. Maria also prompted evacuations from the U.S. Virgin Islands, which already sustained significant damage from Irma. Many Virgin Island evacuees had fled to Puerto Rico.
There were no immediate reports of any deaths in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, but the Associated Press reported that Maria had killed nine people across the Caribbean. Other Caribbean islands, including St. Martin and Barbuda, had already seen most of their housing stock destroyed by Irma.
Nearly 3,200 U.S. government staffers overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency were already in Puerto Rico on Wednesday helping with recovery efforts in the Caribbean after Hurricane Irma hammered the region last week. Even so, first responders were not expected to help right away — officials had said they planned to shelter indoors when winds reached 50 mph.
The White House said in a statement that President Trump is continuing to monitor the situation and that he and First Lady Melania Trump “send their thoughts and prayers to all those in harm’s way.”
Caratini, the attorney, had rented a room at the Sheraton Hotel in Old San Juan to weather the storm. Staff members barricaded doors with lumber and sandbags, activated a generator to keep electricity running on the main floor once it went out in the rest of the nine-story building, and played hurricane coverage on a big-screen television as owners walked evacuated dogs.
“The big thing is not the wind and the rain — it’s the aftermath,” said Caratini, whose house is near the beach.
She worried about those living in the center of the island, where many homes are made of wood and have zinc roofs that were probably ripped apart by the hurricane.
Puerto Rico has been struggling economically, and leaders had planned to reduce public workers’ hours, shifting money from local to federal coffers, Caratini said. She hopes those changes get suspended, at least immediately after the storm.
For years, the commonwealth has struggled with debt. In May, Rossello said the Puerto Rican government would go to federal court in hopes of receiving protection from creditors. The U.S. territory is embrolied in a more than $70-billion debt crisis, after multiple creditors filed lawsuits trying to recuperate millions of dollars invested in government bonds.
The devastation of Maria, the first Category 4 hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in 85 years, will be a further blow to island’s economy, which is anchored by the tourism industry.
At the Sheraton, some had evacuated from other Caribbean islands where they had already survived Irma earlier this month.
“This is better than the last one,” said Ken Wild, 63, an archaeologist with the National Park Service who hid in his hillside basement on the Virgin Island of St. John during Irma only to see the windows blown out. He survived along with his Doberman, Anabell, and so did his boat.
But he didn’t think the boat would survive Maria, which pummeled the Virgin Islands on Tuesday night.
In San Juan on Wednesday, Rosa Avalo recalled the horror before sunrise. Avalo awoke at about 4 a.m. to find 3 to 4 inches of water had entered her 300-year-old home, Casa Lila, where she runs a business teaching tourists to make cheese.
She called to her 18-year-old son, who agreed to leave as soon as he took a shower: ""That's when he started screaming.""
The storm had punched a hole in their bathroom wall several feet wide, large enough that they could see winds lashing a historic fort across the street. They ran to a neighbor's house, where they planned to stay for the near future.
""I never thought it would happen to me, but now I don't have a house,"" she said as she stood in her doorway facing a cracked wall. ""Brace yourselves because I never thought I would lose my house. I thought my house was like a bunker.""
The area was without power, cellphone and Internet service. She was still waiting to hear from relatives in central Puerto Rico, including her 16-year-old daughter, Anna, who was staying with her father in Manati. ""I hope they're safe,"" she said.

Yellen defends Federal Reserve's bond buying as the central bank starts reducing its stockpile,"The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it would start slowly reducing the trillions of dollars in bonds it bought to stimulate the economy, another milestone in the central bank’s efforts to return to a normal monetary policy after the Great Recession.
The long-awaited reduction in the Fed’s $4.5-trillion balance sheet, to begin next month, comes amid a cloudy short-term economic outlook and great uncertainty at the central bank. There are several vacancies on the Fed board, and there could be a change in leadership early next year if President Trump decides not to renominate Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen.
At a news conference Wednesday, Yellen said that she had not met recently with Trump, and she declined to comment about a possible second stint as Fed chairwoman after her first four-year term expires in February.
Yellen also defended the controversial bond-buying effort begun under her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, which she said had helped the economy recover more quickly from the Great Recession of 2007-09.
With the recovery now “on a strong track,” the extra stimulus from the bond purchases is no longer needed, she said.
“I think that the American people should feel the steps we are taking to normalize monetary policy are ones that we feel are well justified given the very substantial progress we’ve seen in the economy,” Yellen said.
Earlier Wednesday, Yellen and her colleagues voted unanimously to leave the Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged. They signaled another small rate hike is coming by the end of the year.
But the recent devastation caused by severe hurricanes could make it difficult for Fed officials to get a solid read on the economy in the coming weeks.
“Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship,” the Fed said in a policy statement Wednesday after its two-day meeting. “Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near-term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.”
One short-term effect of the hurricanes will be higher gasoline prices, which “will likely boost inflation temporarily,” the Fed said.
Inflation has persistently run below the central bank’s 2% annual target, which has made the Fed hesitant to raise rates. Yellen described the low inflation this year as something of a “mystery,” even as she expressed confidence that the measure would move to the Fed’s desired level of 2% next year.
Economists say that negative short-term effects caused by the storms, such as a spike in unemployment claims by workers and shutdowns by businesses in the affected areas, usually are offset by a boost in economic activity when rebuilding begins.
Yellen said national employment numbers for September were likely to be affected by the hurricanes, but noted that she was “very pleased and heartened” by the continued improvement in the labor market in recent months.
Third-quarter economic growth also is expected to be dragged down by the storms, but Fed policymakers actually revised up their forecast for overall growth this year to 2.4% from a 2.2% projection in June.
And the actions taken Wednesday demonstrated their confidence that the economy will continue to grow moderately for the foreseeable future.
As expected, central bank officials voted to hold the benchmark federal funds rate steady at between 1% and 1.25%. But they still are forecasting another increase of 0.25 of a percentage point by the end of the year — a signal they think the economy remains on solid ground.
Their projections were the same as in June for the unemployment rate, which is forecast to be at 4.3% by the end of the year, and for inflation, which is expected to be at an annual 1.6% rate by the end of 2017.
Fed officials have been signaling for months that they planned to start reducing the Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities the central bank began buying in 2008. The purchases were supposed to stimulate growth by pushing down mortgage and other long-term interest rates.
Although economists have varying views about the effect of those purchases, Yellen said they were successful in stimulating the recovery. She cited a recent Fed study indicating that the series of bond purchases, which more than quadrupled the Fed’s balance sheet to $4.5 trillion, had the overall effect of lowering long-term interest rates by about 1 percentage point.
The Fed’s announcement Wednesday that it would begin the reductions next month was based on a detailed plan approved in June. The advanced telegraphing of the move was designed to avoid rattling investors, and financial markets have remained calm as the Fed anticipated taking another key step in reversing its unprecedented stimulus policies.
Financial markets took the news in stride Wednesday. That contrasted with the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when markets convulsed after Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, indicated the Fed was getting ready to slow down the bond purchases.
Still, Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said that the unwinding of the Fed’s stimulus, along with a similar move expected by the European Central Bank next year, posed increased risks for the economy.
“Financial markets will have to get more and more used to the sucking sound of disappearing central bank liquidity over the next few years,” Coulton said. “No one really knows how that will pan out.""
The Fed plans to gradually allow an increasing amount of proceeds from maturing securities to be run off the central bank’s books each month. As the bonds mature, the government pays the face value to the Fed. The Fed would keep some of the proceeds instead of reinvesting them in new bonds.
The amount of proceeds would start at $10 billion a month and increase over the course of a year until they reach $50 billion a month.
Yellen reiterated Wednesday that the Fed intends to reduce its assets “in a gradual and predictable manner,” although policymakers have not specified a target level for how much it wants to shrink the balance sheet. The Fed also plans to keep raising its key interest rate, with most policymakers seeing at least three quarter-point rate hikes next year.
Yellen, however, emphasized as she has in the past that the Fed was not “locked in” to a set course and could stop reducing its assets if the economy began weakening. That view could change under a new Fed chief.
“Although this statement removes some of the uncertainty about monetary policy through the end of this year, there is still a great deal of uncertainty for 2018 and beyond,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services.
There are three empty seats on the Fed’s seven-member board. Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer steps down next month, and Faucher thinks Trump will replace Yellen.
“The Federal Reserve Board, and monetary policy, could look very different next year,” Faucher said.

Iran pushes back on Trump's U.N. attack,"Iran fired back sharply at President Trump at the United Nations on Wednesday, dismissing what it called “ignorant, hateful and absurd rhetoric” and challenging his threats to tear up the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.
A day after Trump denounced Iran as a “rogue state” to the U.N. General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stood before the same gathering of global leaders and diplomats, and aimed the insult back at him.
“It would be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,” Rouhani said of the nuclear accord.
The disarmament deal “belongs to the international community in its entirety, and not only to one or two” governments, he said.
President Obama had argued that the U.N.-approved accord would destroy Iran’s ability to build nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Over the last two years, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, has repeatedly found Iran is complying with the pact.
But Obama also hoped that easing sanctions would draw Iran more into global trade and other systems, ending more than three decades of enmity and isolation, much as China has emerged as a major power.
The latest bitter tit-for-tat at the U.N. lectern shows how U.S.-Iranian relations remain as estranged as ever, with both sides leveling angry charges on the global stage. It comes as Trump simultaneously is trying to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear arms through negotiations or face annihilation.
Trump said Wednesday he has made a decision on whether he will certify to Congress by an Oct. 15 deadline that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal, as he already has done twice this year. But he refused to say what he has decided.
“I have decided,” Trump said three times in response to shouted questions from reporters before he met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at a hotel near the U.N. When pressed further, he smiled and said, “I’ll let you know.”
As recently as Tuesday, administration officials were preparing options for Trump to consider before next month’s deadline. As a candidate he had vowed to abandon the deal, but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson conceded this weekend that Iran is in “technical compliance.”
Senior White House aides are divided on whether to pull out of the agreement or stay in it for fear that withdrawal would cause deep divisions with U.S. allies, and potentially allow Iran to resume the very nuclear program it was designed to stop.
Several of Trump's close advisors have tried to convince him to stay for now to give them time to work with allies to toughen some terms of the agreement.
French President Emmanuel Macron in particular has been working with other European leaders on adding additional measures. He said he had urged Trump in a meeting Monday to stay in the deal.
“I don’t understand what the substitute plan is,” Macron told reporters Tuesday. “If we simply throw away this agreement we can’t replace it.”
If Trump withholds certification — which he has hinted strongly he will — Congress will have 60 days to decide if U.S. sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program should be put back in place.
That would effectively end the U.S. side of the deal. It’s less clear if it would destroy the accord since it also was negotiated by France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany, and none of those governments supports ripping it up.
Trump excoriated Iran in his debut address to the General Assembly on Tuesday.
“The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy,” he said. He called it “an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos.”
He accused Iran of supporting militants in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, expanding its ballistic missile programs, and pursuing “death and destruction” in the Middle East.
“We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles,” he said. “And we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.”
He all but called for regime change in Tehran, saying “the good people of Iran want change and, other than the vast military power of the United States, Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most.”
Rouhani also minced no words in his address Wednesday.
Without mentioning Trump by name, the Iranian leader decried “ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric” delivered in the chamber a day earlier.
He singled out “the new U.S. administration” in saying it would destroy its own credibility by abrogating international agreements.
Rouhani, who won a second presidential term earlier this year, said Iran would not be the first to violate the agreement, but that it would take unspecified steps if others did so.
“We never threaten anyone, but we do not tolerate threats from anyone,” he said. “We believe in dialogue based on equal footing and mutual respect.”
Trump also used his U.N. speech to threaten to “totally destroy” North Korea if an attack is warranted, and again mocked its leader Kim Jong Un as “Rocket Man … on a suicide mission for himself and his regime.”
At the Pentagon, asked about Trump's ""Rocket Man"" comment, Defense Secretary James N. Mattis emphasized diplomacy.
""We are dealing with the North Korea situation through the international process, and we will continue to do so,"" Mattis told reporters. ""Secretary [of State Rex] Tillerson is leading the effort, and we will hopefully get this resolved through diplomatic means.""
Wilkinson and Bennett reported from the United Nations and King reported from Washington.

Here are the major questions before the Supreme Court this fall,"The Supreme Court opens its new term Oct. 2 and will quickly take up major disputes involving President Trump, immigration policy, religious liberty, gay rights and partisan gerrymandering.
Here are the major questions before the court this fall:
Can President Trump temporarily block the entry of foreign travelers from six majority Muslim nations because they pose a “heightened risk” of terrorism, or is his order unconstitutional because it reflects bias against Muslims and is not based on evidence of a true security threat?
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California and the 4th Circuit in Virginia struck down Trump’s order, but in late June, the Supreme Court revived it in part. It also agreed to hear Trump’s claim of broad power over immigration.
But the case may be dismissed as moot because the time limits in the order will have expired by the time arguments are presented.
Trump vs. Hawaii and Trump vs. IRAP is scheduled to be heard Oct. 10.
Can a baker refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of his Christian beliefs, or can the state require that businesses open to the public provide “full and equal” services to customers without regard to their sexual orientation?
Colorado and 20 other states have civil rights laws that protect gays and lesbians. Trump administration lawyers have urged the court to carve out a “narrow” exception based on the freedom of speech for cake makers, photographers, musicians and others whose work is “expressive.”
Masterpiece Cakeshop vs. Colorado is due to be heard in December.
When one party controls a state’s government, can it draw election district maps to “entrench” itself in the majority for another decade, even in elections where most voters cast ballots for other party?
Since the 1980s, the justices have frowned on “partisan gerrymandering” as unfair and corrupt, but they have not agreed on a rule for when an election map tilts so far as to be unconstitutional. By contrast, the court has outlawed racial gerrymandering, but often the lines between racial and partisan gerrymandering are blurred.
The justices will tackle partisan gerrymandering again in a Wisconsin case, Gill vs. Whitford, to be heard on Oct. 3.
Can the FBI and police obtain cellphone data to track the movements of a crime suspect because such phone company-held records are not private, or must they first obtain a search warrant based on probable cause from a magistrate?
Privacy advocates on the right and left urge the court to strictly protect these records. However, investigators say they sometimes need the data to track travel patterns to identify a crime suspect or a terrorist.
Carpenter vs. United States is to be heard in December.
Can companies require workers to waive their rights to join any class or collective action against their employer and instead resolve disputes as individuals through binding arbitration?
Obama administration lawyers told the court these arbitration clauses were illegal under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which said workers had a right to join a union or take “other concerted activities.” In June, the Trump administration switched sides and said these waivers could be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925.
The court will hear the arguments on Oct. 2 in NLRB vs. Murphy Oil and two related cases.
Can noncitizens who are slated for deportation be kept in jail indefinitely, or must they be given a bail hearing after six months?
Acting on a class-action suit in Los Angeles, the 9th Circuit Court said such detainees have a right to bail after six months if they pose no danger to the public and are unlikely to flee. The justices heard the government’s appeal in November, shortly after Trump’s election, but could not reach a decision.
The case, Jennings vs. Rodriguez, will be argued again Oct. 3, and this time Justice Neil M. Gorsuch can cast the deciding vote.
Can states remove voters from their rolls if they fail to vote for two years and do not respond to notices over four years?
The 6th Circuit Court agreed with civil rights lawyers who said this procedure in Ohio violated a federal law that says a voter’s registration may not be canceled for “a failure to vote.”
Husted vs. A. Philip Randolph Institute is to be heard on November 8.
Can New Jersey allow sports betting at its casinos and racetracks, or must it abide by a federal law that prohibits gambling on sports, except in Nevada?
The state has lost repeatedly in lower courts, but the justices will hear its appeal in Christie vs. NCAA.
Can states require teachers and other unionized public employees to pay a fee to cover the cost of collective bargaining?
The court upheld such laws 40 years ago, but anti-union lawyers say these forced payments violate the free-speech rights of workers.
The court was set to decide this issue in 2016 in the case of a California teacher, but after Justice Antonin Scalia died, the justices were split 4-4.
An Illinois child care worker has a new appeal pending this month. The court has not announced whether it will hear Janus vs. AFSCME.
Does the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids employers from discriminating against employees because of their sex, also forbid firing people because of their sexual orientation?
Earlier this year, the 7th Circuit Court in Chicago broke new ground when it ruled that federal law forbids job discrimination based on sexual orientation.
The 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta reached the opposite conclusion in a case involving a Georgia woman who was pushed out of her job as a hospital security guard because she was a lesbian.
Earlier this month she appealed and asked the justices to decide the question in this term. They have not announced whether they will hear Evans vs. Georgia Regional Hospital.

" As Trump works the U.N., Washington focuses on Republicans' last-gasp Obamacare repeal bid ","Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington:
The latest Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would inflict ""real human suffering"" on millions of Americans, former President Barack Obama said Wednesday, speaking out in public defense of his signature healthcare reform effort.
The law has led to major increases in the number of Americans with healthcare coverage, Obama said, speaking in New York at an event on global development sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
""When I see people trying to undo that hard-won progress for the 50th or 60th time,"" he said, ""it is aggravating.""
The Republican efforts would make coverage unavailable to cancer survivors, pregnant women, children with asthma and others with existing medical problems, he said, ""without any ... common sense rationale.""
""It's certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents,"" he added. ""But typically, that's how progress is won, and how progress is maintained.""

Trump seeks to reassure loyalists even as he courts deals with Democrats,"As mainstream media outlets raised questions Tuesday about the wisdom of President Trump labeling North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” from the lectern at the United Nations, the president’s message-making sped into gear.
“Trump supporters around the country should take pride in President Trump’s strong and principled speech before the world’s leaders at the United Nations today where he expressed profound and unwavering America First principles,” Michael S. Glassner, the executive director of Trump’s reelection organization, said in an email blasted out shortly after Trump’s U.N. address.
“The President described a new vision, putting Americans first…and condemning those who support rogue nations and terrorists.”
For two weeks Trump has been in a well-publicized dalliance with Democrats, cutting deals on the federal budget and debt ceiling and seeking an agreement on immigrants who entered the country illegally as young children. At the same time, he has sought to blunt any retribution from his supporters by flooding them with messages focused on why they backed him in the first place.
Tuesday’s speech at the U.N. offered the highest-profile example of how the administration has sought to reassure the president’s supporters, showcasing parts of Trump’s speech that returned to his campaign themes and language.
In the speech, Trump castigated the Iran nuclear deal as “one of the worst” ever made and pledged to stop “radical Islamic terrorism.” He cast immigration and global trade deals as injurious to Americans. He made clear his presidency’s organizing principle remained the one that animated his campaign.

President Trump used variations of the word “sovereign” 21 times during Tuesday’s 42-minute speech to the United Nations General Assembly, driving home his belief that countries, not international institutions like the U.N., will and should determine the fate of the world by pursuing their own...
“Our government’s first duty is to its people, to our citizens, to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights and to defend their values,” he told foreign leaders and a national audience. “As president of the United States I will always put America first.”
Every president is continuously defining himself—or, when things are off track, attempting to redefine himself. For Trump, those efforts are both necessary and, for the last two weeks, simultaneous.
The outreach to Democrats whom the president had long disparaged came after nearly eight months of working only with Republicans. That shift potentially could open the way for Trump to appeal to a new batch of voters, but it also risked his connection to those who had sustained him during a period in which his support has been mired in the mid- to upper-30s range.
To keep those supporters on board, Trump and his allies have relied on a daily drumbeat of news about the president’s goals, achievements and desires, communicating in ways that bypass commentary by Democrats or the media.
Trump’s core supporters detest Democratic leaders and, in part due to the president’s constant disparagements, don’t trust the media’s account of his tenure. That has heightened the power of the president’s own social media and communication tools, which include nearly 39 million Twitter followers and nearly 23 million followers on Facebook.
His messages often find an echo on conservative news sites: On Tuesday the Breitbart media website, whose chief executive Stephen K. Bannon recently served as Trump’s chief strategist, headlined its story “Trump threatens to ‘totally destroy NKorea at U.N.: ‘Rocket Man Is on a Suicide Mission.’ ” On Fox News’ website—the most popular site for Trump voters, polls have shown—a headline offered: “Sticking to script, Trump sticks it to the UN.”
For Trump’s supporters, those headlines evoked one of his strengths, the belief that he speaks their language and is willing to disrupt the establishment anywhere, even in a stronghold such as the United Nations. His desire to thwart convention has been standard in Trump’s favorite communications tool, Twitter, where his offerings over the last two weeks read like mini-drafts of his speech.
He has emphasized issues he knows are important to his followers, who favor a stronger military and who, 2016 presidential exit polls found, were more worried about terrorism than other candidates’ voters.
Repeatedly, Trump has reminded his Twitter followers that he has worked to expand the military. (Much of his effort remains in the pipeline, a point he glosses over.)
“Military and economy are getting stronger by the day and our enemies know it,” he tweeted Sunday.
Trump also asserted that “loser terrorists”—terminology he repeated in the U.N. speech—should be dealt with “in a much tougher manner.”
Trump has also repeatedly heralded his administration’s efforts to help victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. That emphasizes to those supporters who may not relish Trump’s more bellicose statements that his administration is demonstrating competence — every presidency’s desired baseline.
But the uplift is cut by a stream of animosity toward others, whether the leader of North Korea or Trump’s nemesis Hillary Clinton. The “Rocket Man” moniker for Kim that was used at the United Nations first surfaced in a Sunday tweet.
That same day, Trump posted a video made to look like he’d hit a golf ball that knocked over Clinton. The tweet prompted predictable outrage from Democrats, which likely was the reason for posting it in the first place. On Wednesday, he was back to citing his campaign nickname for her: “Crooked Hillary.”
Taken together, Trump’s communication efforts serve to rally supporters to a common cause or, at least, opposition to common enemies. And there is some suggestion his efforts are working: The most recent weekly Gallup poll was one of several that have shown an uptick in his support. It found Trump’s popularity at 38%, still low by the standards of most presidencies, but the highest level since late July.
What Trump has not done, in his messages to supporters or in Tuesday’s speech, is to present detailed solutions to the problems he describes.
Trump did not come into the presidency on the strength of rock-ribbed beliefs; indeed on Tuesday he proudly asserted that he was “guided by outcomes, not ideology.” Eight months into his presidency, he often takes multiple sides on the same set of issues, as if offering options or underscoring deal-desiring flexibility.
Last week, a question about whether he favored amnesty for young immigrants drew a characteristic response.
“We’re not looking at amnesty. We’re looking at allowing people to stay here,” Trump said. By the standards long held by Republicans, allowing people to stay is the definition of amnesty.
This week it was his view of the U.N. that varied. On Monday, as he left the first day of U.N. meetings, he seemed to dismiss the global organization’s record.
“I think the main message is ‘make the United Nations great.’ Not ‘again,’” he said. “Make the United Nations great.“
The next day, in a lunch after his speech, he was effusive with praise, saying that when it came to solving the world’s problems, “there can be no better forum” than the U.N.
That approach can leave foreign leaders mystified as to which course Trump prefers. Yet such inconsistencies rarely trouble Trump’s loyalists, many of whom are attracted less by ideological practicality than by Trump’s manner and tone. The messages they receive from him help to reinforce their personal connection, crafted in the campaign and maintained still.
Harmeet Dhillon, a Republican National Committee member from California, said Trump supporters “are getting plenty of communication from him and from his surrogates” via Twitter, Facebook, emails and the like.
“It has to do with advancing his agenda in a positive way,” she said. “I don’t think there’s any shortage of communication there.”

Afghan leader: Abolishing militant havens in Pakistan is key,"Abolishing militant hideouts in Pakistan is critical to establishing peace in neighboring Afghanistan, the Afghan leader said Thursday before meeting President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
 Neither Trump nor Afghan President Ashraf Ghani mentioned Pakistan when they appeared publicly together after their discussion. But Ghani said Pakistan's role is an important part of the Trump plan announced last month to end America's longest war and eliminate a rising extremist threat in Afghanistan.
 ""Reduction of safe havens is absolutely necessary, both for counterterrorism and for stability in Afghanistan,"" Ghani told National Public Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday.
 The Trump administration in August infuriated Pakistan by accusing it of providing haven to extremists. The U.S. also has threatened to withhold military aid from Pakistan. The country repeatedly has said it is acting against Taliban insurgents and members of the Haqqani militant group.
 ""I hope that this time, Pakistanis get the message loud and clear that business as usual cannot continue. It's not in their interest. It's not in anyone's interest,"" Ghani said.
 After meeting Ghani, Trump praised efforts to try to drive members of more than 20 militant groups, including the Taliban, out of Afghanistan.
 ""It's really a hornet's nest from that standpoint,"" Trump said. ""We are hitting them very, very hard and very, very effectively.""
 Senior officials have said Trump's plan for Afghanistan involves sending up to 3,900 additional U.S. troops on top of the roughly 8,400 Americans now in the country.
 Ghani stressed that Afghan forces are leading the fight and U.S. forces are advising and training. He said he isn't seeking ""a blank check"" of unlimited American help.
 Ghani said the Trump administration's four-year objective is to bring 80 percent of the country back under the government's control. The Taliban currently hold sway in nearly half of the nation.
 Separately Thursday, an independent auditor of U.S. efforts in Afghanistan released a report saying that although the U.S. has spent more than $70 billion in the past 16 years to build up the Afghani security forces, they're still struggling. Problems include morale, drug use, illiteracy, corruption, poor leadership and the challenges caused by ongoing, annual rotation of U.S. advisers and trainers.
 ""To put it plainly, as our report does, the United States failed to understand the complexities and scale of the mission required to stand up and mentor security forces in a country suffering from 30 years of war, misrule, corruption and deep poverty,"" John Sopko, the congressionally appointed special inspector general, said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 Afghan forces are sustaining high casualties. Large swaths of the country are off-limits to foreigners. U.S. embassy personnel are mostly stuck behind the walls of the Kabul embassy. They can't train judicial and police staff or offer technical support to Afghan ministries, according to the report, which described civilian advisers ""now forced to move with armed guards in convoys or even by helicopter"" to meet Afghan officials.
 The U.S. government is still struggling to build a security force in a nation of 70 percent illiteracy and few with technological know-how. It has trained more than 100,000 Afghan police officers using U.S. Army aviators, infantry officers and civilian contractors.
 ""One U.S. officer watched TV shows like 'Cops' and 'NCIS' to learn what he should teach,"" Sopko said. ""In eastern Afghanistan, we met a U.S. Army helicopter pilot assigned to teach policing. We found one U.S. police-training unit set up as a military unit and another set up like a police unit.""
 Between 2002 and 2015, he said, senior U.S. and NATO officials created a plan for developing the force with ""little to no input"" from senior Afghan officials.
 ""At one point, training sessions for Afghan police were using PowerPoint-based curricula from the U.S.-NATO Balkan operations,"" Sopko said.
 The report also said development of the police has been treated as a secondary mission to the army despite its critical role in battling lawlessness and providing security. Today, the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, is among Afghanistan's most corrupt institutions — which Ghani publicly acknowledged this year.

Prosecutors: Texas lawmaker spent $51K on online psychic,"A Texas lawmaker apparently spent more than $51,000 of her own money on an online psychic, showed up for work at the Capitol impaired by medication and hid a cellphone from investigators, prosecutors allege in a court filing this week.
 Rep. Dawnna Dukes is due to face misdemeanor corruption charges at an Oct. 16 trial. She is accused of giving a taxpayer-funded raise to a legislative aide to cover gas money for shuttling her daughter back and forth from school.
 The Travis County prosecutors' court filing this week is intended to inform Dukes' attorneys of allegations against her that will be asserted at trial. She's not facing charges pertaining to the allegations included in the filing.
 ""Under Texas law, the state is required to give notice to the defendant of any evidence, not arising from the same transaction as that on trial, that the state might attempt to introduce to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident,"" District Attorney Margaret Moore said in a statement to the Austin American-Statesman .
 Dukes' attorney, Dane Ball, declined to comment on the allegations.
 The Travis County district attorney's office alleges in the filing that Dukes paid for the psychic from December 2014 to January 2016, totaling nearly $1,000 a week. She apparently used her own money for the payments; the court document doesn't indicate public funds were used. The district attorney's office didn't return a call Thursday seeking clarification.
 Authorities contend she was noticeably impaired on one occasion while performing legislative duties at the Capitol. She showed up late to a House appropriations committee hearing on March 29 and at one point said, ""I know I'm talking a lot. I'm full of morphine and will be headed out of here soon.""
 She's also accused of giving investigators a different cellphone from the one they were seeking when they served her with a search warrant. In addition, the filing says Dukes was absent for roll call 65 percent of the time during the 2017 legislative regular session, and 36 percent of the time in the special session.
 Prosecutors still want to salvage a felony case against the lawmaker, the American-Statesman reported. The DA's office last week placed 13 felony charges against Dukes on hold after a legislative official gave conflicting information about reimbursement vouchers that Dukes is alleged to have falsified in 2013 and 2014 for days she did not travel to the Capitol.
 Dukes previously had announced plans to resign, citing yearslong medical concerns. But she reneged in January and was sworn in for her 12th term.

"In defiance to US, Iran unveils latest missile during parade","Iran's Revolutionary Guard on Friday unveiled its latest ballistic missile capable of reaching much of the Middle East, including Israel, while the country's president vowed that Tehran would press ahead with its missile program in defiance of U.S. demands to the contrary.
 The unveiling came during a military parade in Tehran that commemorated the 1980s Iraq-Iran war.
 The move was a direct challenge to President Donald Trump, who in August signed a bill imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran's ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.
 Though Iran has long boasted of having missiles in the same range in its arsenal, it was the first time that the Khoramshahr, with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) was displayed in public.
 In February, Iran test-fired the same medium-range type of missile, prompting Trump to say that the United States is ""putting Iran on notice.""
 Trump has vowed repeatedly to take a tougher line toward Iran than his predecessor, threatening at various times to renegotiate or even dismantle the nuclear deal, and shoot Iranian boats out of the water if they provoke U.S. naval vessels in the Persian Gulf.
 Friday's parade also showcased various Iranian army units and Revolutionary Guard forces, as well as the police. Similar parades were held in other Iranian cities.
 Rouhani addressed the parade in Tehran, saying that Iran would not halt its missile program but continue to boost military capabilities, despite U.S. demands.
 ""We will strengthen our defense and military capabilities ... whether you want it or not,"" Rouhani said, a direct response to Trump's speech at the U.N. General Assembly this week.
 Rouhani added that ""Iran's military power lies in its commitment to never invade another country or land.""
 He also said Tehran will keep supporting the ""oppressed people of Yemen, Syria and Palestine"" — a reference to Iran's role in the wars in Yemen and Syria and its support for Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas.
 Tehran has backed Yemen's Shiite rebels known as Houthis against a U.S.-supported and Saudi-led coalition of mostly Arab states that seeks to return the internationally elected government to power in Yemen. In Syria, Iran is a close ally of President Bashar Assad.
 In his speech at the United Nations, Trump accused Iran of supporting terrorists and called Tehran a ""corrupt dictatorship"" and a ""murderous regime.""
 Speaking a day later, Rouhani said the Iranian people are waiting for an apology from Trump for his ""extremely offensive"" rhetoric and ""unfounded"" allegations about Iran.
 Rouhani afterward told a news conference that the Trump administration is seeking ""an excuse"" to pull out of the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement that capped Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions on Iran.
 The deal, Rouhani said, is supported by his government and the five other parties — Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — that signed the agreement.
 Not many details are known about Khoramshahr. The state-run IRNA news agency quoted chief of the Guard's airspace division, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, as saying that the ballistic missile ""can carry several warheads for various uses."" The agency did not provide further information.
 Later on Friday, Iranians staged anti-Trump protest to show their anger over the U.S. president's speech. Thousands of worshippers marched after Friday prayers in Tehran, chanting ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel.""
 State media said similar protests took place in other Iranian cities and towns.
 On Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all major policies in Iran, said Trump's ""cheap, ugly, foolish and unreal"" remarks before the U.N. General Assembly were a sign of desperation. During a meeting with a clerical assembly, Khamenei said such comments ""do not come from power, but from anger, desperation and weak-mindedness.""
 The nuclear deal between Iran and world powers does not strictly prohibit Iran from developing missiles but after the deal came into effect last year, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution calling on Iran not to take any actions related to ballistic missiles ""designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons"" for eight years.
 Iranian officials have argued that the measure only applies to missiles specifically designed to carry nuclear warheads.

Mexico shocked by news: Girl trapped in rubble didn't exist,"Hour after excruciating hour, Mexicans were transfixed by dramatic efforts to reach a young girl thought buried in the rubble of a school destroyed by a magnitude 7.1 earthquake. She reportedly wiggled her fingers, told rescuers her name and said there were others trapped near her. Rescue workers called for tubes, pipes and other tools to reach her.
 News media, officials and volunteer rescuers all repeated the story of ""Frida Sofia"" with a sense of urgency that made it a national drama, drawing attention away from other rescue efforts across the quake-stricken city and leaving people in Mexico and abroad glued to their television sets.
 But she never existed, Mexican navy officials now say.
 ""We want to emphasize that we have no knowledge about the report that emerged with the name of a girl,"" navy Assistant Secretary Angel Enrique Sarmiento said Thursday. ""We never had any knowledge about that report, and we do not believe — we are sure — it was not a reality.""
 Sarmiento said a camera lowered into the rubble of the Enrique Rebsamen school showed blood tracks where an injured person apparently dragged himself or herself, and the only person still listed as missing was a school employee. But it was just blood tracks — no fingers wiggling, no voice, no name. Several dead people have been removed from the rubble, and it could have been their fingers rescuers thought they saw move.
 Sarmiento later apologized for being so categorical, saying that if a person is still trapped it could be a child or an adult.
 ""The information existing at this moment doesn't allow us to say if it is an adult or a child,"" Sarmiento said. ""As long as there is the slightest possibility of someone alive, we will continue searching with the same energy.""
 Twitter users quickly brought out the ""Fake News"" tag and complained that the widespread coverage had distracted attention from real rescue efforts where victims have been pulled victims from the rubble — something that hasn't happened at the school in at least a day.
 Viewers across the country hung on the round-the-clock coverage of the drama Wednesday from the only network that was permitted to enter. The military, which ran the rescue operation, spoke directly only to the network's reporters inside the site.
 The Associated Press and others reported about the search for the girl, based on interviews with rescue workers leaving the scene who believed it was true. The workers had been toiling through the night, and the chance of rescuing the girl appeared to give them hope and purpose despite their exhaustion.
 Reports about the trapped girl led to the donations of cranes, support beams and power tools at the school site — pleas for help quickly met based on the urgency of rescuing children. It was unclear if that affected other rescue operations going on simultaneously at a half dozen other sites across the city.
 Despite all the technology brought to bear at the school, including thermal imaging devices, sensors, scanners and remote cameras, the mistake may have come down to a few over-enthusiastic rescuers who, one-by one, crawled into the bottom of shafts tunneled into the rubble looking for any signs of life.
 ""I don't think there was bad faith involved,"" security analyst Alejandro Hope said. ""You want to believe there are children still alive down there.""
 Rescuers interviewed by the AP late Wednesday at a barricade that blocked most journalists from reaching the site believed the story of the girl implicitly. Operating on little sleep and relying on donated food and tools, rescuers were emotionally wedded to the story, and the adrenaline it provided may have been the only thing keeping them going.
 Rescue worker Raul Rodrigo Hernandez Ayala came out from the site Wednesday night and said that ""the girl is alive, she has vital signs,"" and that five more children had been located alive. ""There is a basement where they found children.""
 Despite the setback — and the diminishing hopes that anyone was left under the rubble — rescuers appeared unwilling to question the effort.
 ""It was a confusion,"" said Alfredo Padilla, a volunteer rescuer at the school. ""The important thing is there are signs of life and we are working on that.""
 In retrospect, the story of ""Frida Sofia,"" had some suspicious points from the start.
 Officials couldn't locate any relatives of the missing girl, and no girl with that name attended the school. Rescuers said they were still separated from her by yards of rubble, but could somehow still hear her.
 It could have political repercussions: Education Secretary Aurelio Nuno, often mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, had repeated the story about the girl.
 Hope noted ""something similar happened in 1985,"" referring to the magnitude 8.0 quake that killed 9,500 people.
 Media quickly reported that a 9-year-old boy had been located in the rubble days after the Sept. 19 quake 32 years ago. Rescuers mobilized in a huge effort to find the boy, but he apparently never existed.
 ""That generated anger against those who had spread the story,"" Hope said.

"Milan Fashion Week: When times go dark, Armani goes bright","The fashion crowd eased into the day Friday, the third day of Milan Fashion Week, after a late night raising money for AIDS research at the annual amfAR Milan gala.
 The amfAR foundation honored Angela Missoni for her contributions to the cause at the Thursday night gala, with tenor Andrea Bocelli entertaining the crowd with Elvis Presley's ""Can't Help Falling in Love With You"" in a duet with his wife Veronica Berti.
 Bocelli also participated in the auction to raise funds for research, and will host two winning bidders and their guests at a concert and private dinner in Tuscany. The price tag for each package: 35,000 euros, toward amfAR's goal of a cure for AIDS by 2020.
 Champagne flowed into the wee hours with after-party music by DJs Dimitri From Paris and Johnny Dynell.
 Here are some highlights from Friday's womenswear looks for next spring and summer, featuring Giorgio Armani, Versace and Roberto Cavalli.
 ____
 ARMANI'S ATELIER
 When the times go dark, Giorgio Armani goes bright.
 The 83-year-old designer's Armani collection for next spring and summer bursts with florals and color, often on a background of black. The silhouette is loose and feminine, with short skirts featuring leg-revealing tulip hemlines, sheer organza pantsuits with an easy cut and casual apron dress with abstract florals.
 The designer often layered florals and prints over dark underlays — perhaps a message to see the brighter side of things. At other times he placed a sheer layer over prints, creating a smoky effect. Silken printed skirts opened over a black dress, or a long, draping foulard tucked across the front of a cocktail dress. The prints were inspired by painters, the designer won't say whom.
 ""I respond to sadness with color,"" ANSA quoted the designer as saying.
 The primary color combinations for daywear are red and purple with black accents, segueing into grays for formal suits and black for evening.
 Despite the designer's intentions, long black veils over cocktail dresses had a funereal feel, and somehow the pompoms bouncing on scarves and bedecking caps failed to provide levity. The prevalent bangle shape: Teardrops.
 THE LIGHTNESS OF CATE
 Cate Blanchett looked relaxed in a red-and-white checked double-breasted Armani suit as she arrived to take her front row seat alongside Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and Princess Charlene of Monaco.
 ""It's a beautiful sunny day, so I am wearing something light,"" Blanchett said. ""I cannot wait to see the show.""
 Asked about the industry's moves toward sustainability, championed by the Italian Fashion Chamber ,Blanchett responded: ""It's the only way forward.""

5 things to know about N. Korean leader's rebuke of Trump,"On the surface it seems like more of the same: North Korea responds to another threat by U.S. President Donald Trump by calling him a ""deranged"" old man who will ""pay dearly"" for his insults.
 These words, however, carry the weight of an unprecedented personal rebuke from North Korea's supreme leader, Kim Jong Un.
 Behind Kim's colorful language released Friday is a remarkable window into the thinking — albeit filtered through state media — of the leader of a country that, despite opposition by the world's sole superpower, stands on the brink of nuclear weapons mastery.
 Here are five things to know about Kim Jong Un's statement:
 ___
 HE'S BREAKING GROUND
 It was written in the first person, and issued directly to the international community generally and to Trump specifically.
 Seoul's Unification Ministry, which is responsible for North-South relations, said it was the first time a North Korean leader had addressed the world with such a direct statement.
 The ministry said neither of the two men to rule North Korea before Kim Jong Un — his father, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, national founder Kim Il Sung — issued any similar statements.
 It could be that Kim felt that a direct, personal response was crucial because of the harshness of Trump's comments. The U.S. president vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" on North Korea, used the nickname ""Rocket Man"" for Kim, and at the U.N. on Tuesday threatened to ""totally destroy"" the North if provoked.
 HE'S ISSUING A WARNING
 The statement suggests more powerful weapons tests are in the works.
 North Korea's foreign minister seemed to confirm this on the sidelines of a global U.N. meeting in New York, telling reporters that Kim's comments could mean that North Korea will conduct an H-bomb test in the Pacific, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
 Ri Yong Ho added that no one knows for sure, and Kim would make any decisions on such a test, which would be viewed as massively provocative by Washington.
 Analysts in Seoul also saw the statement as a warning that more tests, possibly of the country's developmental intercontinental ballistic missiles, should be expected.
 HE'S PLAYING THE STATESMAN
 Believe it or not, Kim's statement actually used gentler language than his propaganda specialists have favored in the past.
 Granted, he called Trump a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard"" (a word to describe a fragile elderly person) and a ""frightened dog.""
 But this is a far cry from North Korea at its worst.
 North Korea has previously embraced racist, sexist and just plain rude statements about its enemies. It repeatedly called one past South Korean leader ""rat faced."" It has said that the South's first female president, Park Geun-hye, was a ""crafty prostitute"" and suggested ex-President Barack Obama was her pimp. It also called Obama a ""monkey.""
 Trump will surely not appreciate the language, but it's a far cry from North Korean anger at full force. That suggests Kim could be trying to take a more statesmanlike path than his state media.
 HE FEELS JUSTIFIED
 Kim says Trump's threats only emphasize that North Korea has been justified in its pursuit of nuclear missiles.
 North Korea has long said that its weapons tests are necessary because of U.S. hostility, which for Pyongyang includes the nearly 80,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and South Korea.
 Each Trump threat plays into this narrative.
 Here's the key line in Kim's argument: ""His (Trump's) remarks which described the U.S. option through straightforward expression of his will have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last.""
 __
 HE'S INSULTED
 Kim seemed to take umbrage that Trump was personally insulting him. After all, he typically leaves the threats to his propaganda mavens and lower-level officials.
 Kim essentially says that he expected better of Trump. Because the U.S. president was speaking publicly on the world stage at the U.N., Kim thought he'd resort to ""stereo-typed, prepared remarks a little different from what he used to utter in his office on the spur of the moment.""
 ""But, far from making remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful to defusing tension, he made unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessors,"" Kim continued.
 Kim offered some unsolicited advice to Trump as well. He advised the president ""to exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the world.""
 He added that ""Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world.""
 In a country where Kim's word is law, the message seems clear: This will not stand.

China: Trump bank ban statement 'not consistent' with facts,"U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement that Beijing told its banks to stop dealing with North Korea is ""not consistent with the facts,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Friday, but he gave no indication what steps China might be taking.
 The spokesman, Lu Kang, said Beijing complies with U.N. Security Council resolutions. The council has told member countries to ban most activity abroad by North Korea's banks in response to its nuclear and missile tests.
 Asked at a regular briefing about Trump's comment, Lu said, ""As far as I know, what you have mentioned just now is not consistent with the facts.""
 Lu gave no explanation but added, ""in principle, China has always implemented the U.N. Security Council's resolutions in their entirety and fulfilled our due responsibility.""
 China wants to stop North Korea's nuclear and missile development but has warned against pushing the government of Kim Jong Un so hard it collapses or hurting ordinary North Koreans.
 China accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea's foreign trade. Beijing has cut off imports of coal, iron ore, seafood and other goods in line with U.N. sanctions.
 Trump praised China on Thursday for what he said was instructions to its banks to cut off business with North Korea. He said the action ""was a somewhat unexpected move and we appreciate it.""
 U.S. officials would not confirm that. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he spoke at length with the head of China's central bank but ""I am not going to comment on confidential discussions.""
 The Chinese central bank would not take questions by phone and did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
 Also Thursday, Trump issued an executive order expanding the Treasury Department's ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with North Korea and to ban them from the U.S. financial system.
 It imposes a 180-day ban on vessels and aircraft that have visited North Korea from visiting the United States.
 Trump announced the measures as he met the leaders of South Korea and Japan, the nations most immediately imperiled by North Korea's threats of a military strike.

"France renews half of senators' seats, a test for Macron","On Sunday, France will elect nearly half its Senate, in a vote that is expected to illustrate the slide in President Emmanuel Macron's popularity since his election earlier this year.
 A look at what's at stake for his government and upcoming reforms.
 ___
 THE ELECTION
 The election involves around half of the Senate — or 171 of the chamber's 348 seats. The senators, who will be elected for six-year terms, are chosen by more than 75,000 elected officials, including members of the National Assembly, mayors, regional and local councilors.
 French Senators debate and vote laws along with the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament. However, the National Assembly, where Macron's party has a large majority, has the final say.
 IN-BUILT BIAS
 Sunday's elections are expected to consolidate the Senate's conservative majority, now composed of 142 members of The Republicans party.
 Macron's newly created centrist party, La Republique En Marche, or Republic On the Move, currently has 29 seats. The party hopes to reach 50 senators.
 The voting system, based on elected officials, tends to give an advantage to locally rooted politicians from traditional parties, rather than the candidates of Macron's party, many of whom are newcomers in politics.  Many local elected officials have recently been upset by Macron's plan to slash budgets of local authorities and that could see the president's allies getting fewer votes than might have been the case a few months ago.
 MACRON'S CHALLENGING CONTEXT
 The election come in the wake of Macron's declining popularity since his election in May. Budget cuts, including a decrease in housing aid for students, have contributed to his lower poll rating as has a divisive labor reform package that will involve the use of a special procedure to avoid a lengthy debate at parliament.
 The reforms have prompted strikes and demonstrations as unions protest against the weakening the country's famous workers protections.
 Further protests are scheduled Saturday following a call from hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon.
 UPCOMING REFORMS
 Macron's party will seek an alliance at the Senate with other centrists, some center-leaning Socialists and some members of The Republicans party, in the hope of pass some controversial bills more swiftly.
 The president may well need the help to make changes to unemployment benefits and the pension system next year as well as to the French Constitution. He has suggested the scrapping of the special justice court for government members and limiting lawmakers to three terms.
 To do that without calling a referendum, Macron needs a three-fifths majority vote by parliament — that is 555 out of 925 lawmakers at the Assembly and the Senate.
 That implies support from lawmakers from other parties.

"In Mexico, scenes of desolation and hope as the death toll reaches 274","

Tuesday's earthquake caused death and extensive damage in Mexico City and elsewhere in central Mexico on the anniversary of a deadly 1985 temblor.
Scenes of desolation and rejoicing unspooled Thursday at the sites of buildings crumbled by Mexico’s deadly earthquake, which killed at least 274 people and galvanized heroic efforts to reach those trapped.
But a parallel drama transpired as the government announced that there were no missing children in the ruins of a collapsed school — after the country was transfixed for a night and a day by reports of a 12-year-old girl feebly signaling to rescuers from under the rubble.
Outrage ensued over what many Mexicans believed was a deliberate deception.
On Thursday afternoon, the Mexican navy reported that there was no sign that any child was missing and alive in the rubble of the Enrique Rebsamen school on Mexico City’s south side, where at least 19 children and six adults had died. One more adult might still be trapped in the rubble, navy Undersecretary Angel Enrique Sarmiento said at a news conference.
“All of the children are unfortunately dead,” he said, “or safe at home.”
Mexico’s larger tragedy continued to unfold as rescuers in three states, battling grinding fatigue and mountains of rubble, raced against time, keenly aware of ever-dwindling odds of finding people alive beneath the debris after Tuesday’s magnitude 7.1 temblor.
The overall confirmed fatality count was expected to climb as more bodies were recovered. Rescuers at sites across the sprawling metropolis of Mexico City used search dogs and calls to the cellphones of those trapped to try to pinpoint the location of anyone who had survived two nights under the remains of damaged buildings.


As rescue efforts enter a third day, Mexicans have been captivated by the fate of earthquake victim “Frida Sofia,” a young girl supposedly trapped under the collapsed Enrique Rebsamen school in Mexico City.


But even as Frida Sofia gained fame around the world, her story quickly began to fall apart.
The harrowing rescue effort at the Enrique Rebsamen school had become a social media sensation when news outlets began reporting intensively about the search for a trapped girl thought to be named “Frida Sofia.”
By Thursday afternoon, authorities said that at least one boy or girl was believed to be alive in the wrecked building but that they were not sure of the child’s name. Then the navy’s announcement dashed any remaining hopes for small survivors.
The confusing Frida Sofia saga took another strange turn Thursday night, when a grim-faced Sarmiento went on live television and sought to explain earlier statements by the navy about the girl. He ended up confusing matters even further.
Earlier Thursday, Sarmiento had insisted that the navy never had any knowledge of a girl who was supposedly trapped in the rubble.
In his evening news conference, however, Sarmiento contradicted the earlier statement, conceding that the navy had distributed reports of a girl surviving inside the school “based on technical reports and the testimony of civilian rescue workers and of this institution.” He offered no explanation for the conflicting accounts, but apologized.
“I offer an apology to Mexicans for the information given this afternoon in which I said that the navy did not have any details about a supposed minor survivor in this tragedy,” Sarmiento, dressed in military fatigues, told reporters at an outdoor news conference.
Sarmiento repeated his earlier assertion that it was possible that someone remained alive in the rubble. But Thursday evening he did not rule out the possibility that it was a child. Mexicans and others following the matter were left perplexed.
“Nonetheless,” Sarmiento added, “the Mexican people should know that as long as the minimum possibility exists that there is someone alive, we will keep on looking with the same determination.”
Both he and a colleague, Maj. Jose Luis Vergara, denied any effort to mislead the public.
For many, the fate of one little boy or girl became a symbolic stand-in for a panorama of loss, either threatened or realized. Even for those without casualties in their circle of family and friends, widely shared news of the rescue effort at the school provided a national commonality after the quake had robbed so many of any sense of safety and normality.
Outside quake-wrecked buildings, successful rescues heartened everyone. Cheers erupted overnight at the site of a collapsed multistory office building in Mexico City’s Condesa neighborhood where rescuers pulled three people alive from the rubble, witnesses said. More were believed still trapped, authorities said.
Shows of solidarity were everywhere. On Thursday morning, volunteers armed with shovels lined up near the rescue site to relieve those who had been moving rubble all night. Other volunteers handed out coffee, sandwiches and chilaquiles — a popular Mexican breakfast dish — to dust-covered rescuers.
A continual stream of cars pulled up at makeshift donation centers: ordinary people dropping off food, water, gloves, hard hats and protective face masks.
President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has declared three days of national mourning, on Thursday paid a hospital visit to some of those injured in the quake.
An elite team of disaster experts, including an urban search-and-rescue team from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, landed in Mexico City to aid in relief efforts.
The U.S. Agency for International Development reported the arrival of its Disaster Assistance Response Team, along with more than 60 firefighters and five highly trained dogs.
The USAID team, requested by the Mexican government, will conduct damage assessments, search for victims and coordinate with local authorities and aid groups to bring assistance to those most affected.
As dawn broke, rescue efforts pushed ahead in neighborhoods rich and poor. Hours earlier, in Condesa, a woman’s faint voice could hardly be heard under a pile of rubble that had been her second-story apartment. Rescuers thought there could be up to four people under the collapsed ruins.
Standing atop the building’s remains on Wednesday night, firefighters, soldiers and volunteers peeled back entire floors in slices, digging past people’s belongings: books, blankets, clothes, an ironing board. Couches and pillows went flying.
The rescuers demanded silence. One of them stuck his head down into the void, calling for anyone there to answer if possible. But it was still too loud. Generators and vehicles were turned off. Small chatter subsided.
“We need absolute silence,” the worker said. “Please.”
From a few dozen yards away, the voice sounded like a whisper. The rescuers waited. The trapped woman called to them again.
People stood still, captivated. Some of them wept. A woman broke the silence, yelling over a megaphone: “She is Lorna. She’s on the second floor.”
The woman said Lorna’s family was trying to call her. Seconds later, a phone chimed from inside the pile.


It was supposed to be a joyous occasion, the baptism of a baby girl in this sweltering sugar-cane hub south of Mexico City.


But the celebration at Santiago the Apostle Catholic Church turned abruptly tragic Tuesday when a massive earthquake rocked violently through the main square.


The colonial-style...
After Lorna spoke, the workers quickened their pace, passing buckets of concrete down lines of volunteers to a truck for disposal. A storm had come into the city around 7:30 p.m., pummeling the site with rain for several minutes. Thunder crackled, and lightning flashed.
Later in the evening, a woman was pulled from the rubble along with two bodies. The woman was transported to a hospital. It was unclear whether it was Lorna.
At 5 a.m., rescuers recovered another body from the building: that of Gabriela Jaen Pimienta, 44 — found hugging her Chihuahua, also dead. She had lived on the fifth floor with her husband and daughter, who both survived the earthquake, said relatives who had kept a day-and-night vigil.
In parts of the city, life appeared to be returning to normal Thursday. People stood in front of their homes, sweeping away leaves that had fallen in the overnight rainstorm. Mexico City's tamale vendors were back on the streets, hawking their wares from the backs of bicycles.
But neighborhoods more affected by the quake looked like war zones. Large army trucks lined a popular thoroughfare. Soldiers guarded a park where rescue efforts were being coordinated.
Many rescuers had worked through the night. The lucky ones had slept a little in soggy tents assembled in the park.
President Trump announced new sanctions against North Korea. Facebook will share more than 3,000 ads with congressional panels probing election meddling. In the moments after Tuesday's earthquake, Mexicans quickly mobilized.

Rescuers continued working, hoping to find survivors in a collapsed Mexico City school after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the region the day before. (Sept. 20, 2017)
As rescue efforts enter a third day, Mexicans have been captivated by the fate of earthquake victim “Frida Sofia,” a young girl supposedly trapped under the collapsed Enrique Rebsamen school in Mexico City.
But even as Frida Sofia gained fame around the world, her story quickly began to fall apart.
Government officials never confirmed the identity of such a child. No student was registered at the school under that name, they insisted.
The secretary of education on Thursday also said authorities had been unable to locate any parents of a girl identified in widespread Mexican media reports as the 12-year-old Frida Sofia.
And on Thursday afternoon, the Mexican navy reported that there were no signs that a child was still alive in the wreckage of the three-story school building that was turned into a mound of concrete rubble by Tuesday’s magnitude 7.1 earthquake.
“All of the children are, unfortunately, dead or safe at home,” said Angel Enrique Sarmiento, the undersecretary of the navy. In fact, he said, government authorities were never aware of the existence of any child named Frida Sofia.
The confusing Frida Sofia saga took another strange turn Thursday night, when a grim-faced Sarmiento went on live television and sought to explain earlier statements by the navy about the girl. He ended up confusing matters even further.
Earlier Thursday, Sarmiento had insisted that the navy never had any knowledge of a girl who was supposedly trapped in the rubble.
In his evening news conference, however, Sarmiento contradicted the earlier statement, conceding that the navy had distributed reports of a girl surviving inside the school “based on technical reports and the testimony of civilian rescue workers and of this institution.” He offered no explanation for the conflicting accounts, but apologized.
“I offer an apology to Mexicans for the information given this afternoon in which I said that the navy did not have any details about a supposed minor survivor in this tragedy,” Sarmiento, dressed in military fatigues, told reporters at an outdoor news conference.
Sarmiento repeated his earlier assertion that it was possible that someone remained alive in the rubble. But Thursday evening he did not rule out the possibility that it was a child. Mexicans and others following the matter were left perplexed.
“Nonetheless,” Sarmiento added, “the Mexican people should know that as long as the minimum possibility exists that there is someone alive, we will keep on looking with the same determination.”
Both he and a colleague, Maj. Jose Luis Vergara, denied any effort to mislead the public.
Hope that a child was still alive at the school had energized emergency crews and volunteers who have extracted more than 20 bodies, mostly those of children, from the collapsed structure.
The story of the missing girl had inspired the hashtag #FridaSofia, which trended on Twitter. Mexicans captivated by the story shared it as a beacon of optimism and hope across social media.
Much of the story appeared to originate from reporters for the Televisa network. They said on social media that the girl told rescue workers that she was with five other classmates.
News that there apparently was no living girl under the rubble prompted a new social media eruption, this one of outrage.
“Fake news,” many people tweeted.
“State-run media failed hoax,” said one Twitter user. “Distracted [international] community for at least 72 hours.”
For some Mexicans, the ghostly saga of Frida Sofia was reminiscent of the attempted rescue tale of Luis “Monchito” Navarrete, a 9-year-old boy who was believed to be buried with his grandfather under the rubble of an apartment building after the magnitude 8.1 earthquake that hit Mexico City in 1985.
According to news stories from the time, rescue workers spent more than two weeks trying to rescue the boy and his grandfather after apparently communicating with the boy.
Hope rose and fell for the boy’s parents, who kept a vigil in the street, especially as workers alternately said they had spoken to the boy, then recanted their story.
In the end, the grandfather’s body was extracted from the building, but not the boy’s.

Mexicans aren't counting on the government to rescue them. They're saving themselves,"

Tuesday's earthquake caused death and extensive damage in Mexico City and elsewhere in central Mexico on the anniversary of a deadly 1985 temblor.
In the moments after the earthquake, they didn’t cower, they mobilized.
By the tens of thousands, volunteers streamed toward the Mexico City neighborhoods most damaged by Tuesday’s violent temblor. Some carried shovels, others hauled donations of food and water. Many simply offered up two good hands.
They weren’t public authorities or professionals. They were ordinary Mexicans who knew from experience that during a crisis such as an earthquake, it’s better to do things yourself than to rely on the government for help.
Exactly 32 years before this week’s magnitude 7.1 earthquake brought down dozens of buildings and killed more than 270 people across central Mexico, a more devastating temblor leveled a much vaster stretch of Mexico City.


A powerful 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico on Sept. 19, killing at least 274 people and collapsing homes and bridges across hundreds of miles.
Many Mexicans remember the 1985 earthquake not only for its destruction but also for the government’s lackluster response.
“The government pretty much disappeared for the first 24 hours,” said Alejandro Hope, a political and security analyst who was 14 at the time of the 1985 quake.
With scores trapped beneath the rubble and many more in need of other assistance, “the army was just blocking the streets, not helping particularly,” he said. It was days before then-President Miguel de la Madrid visited a rescue site, he said.
Manuel Montes, a geological engineer, was 33 when the ’85 earthquake hit.
""The government was frightened, there wasn't an immediate response from the city or federal government,"" he said.
In the aftermath, citizens were left to deal with a frightening new reality.
""I went to look for a friend, and there were piles of bodies,"" he said. ""You don't see that today. At that time, the city smelled of death. There were areas you couldn't go to because it reeked of death.""
According to Hope, the real heroes then were the civilians who stepped up, often moving debris with bare hands.
If ordinary Mexicans learned a lesson from the disaster, so too did Mexico’s politicians. Anger about the government’s response — it refused to accept international aid for several days, and it suppressed estimates of the number of dead — helped turn opinion against De la Madrid’s Institutional Revolutionary Party.
The response of current President Enrique Peña Nieto, who deployed more than 3,000 soldiers to help and visited a rescue site the first day of the earthquake, shows that politicians learned “that the only thing you cannot do during a disaster is hide,” Hope said.
Despite quick government action, volunteers showed up, in many areas forming human chains to deliver aid supplies or move rubble, or warn pedestrians against getting near dangerous sites.
They worked all day, all night, all day and all night again.
Paramanand Kaur, an event organizer who lives in Mexico City’s Condesa neighborhood, said she had slept only one hour since the earthquake. After it struck, she ran to a collapsed building and began handing out masks to the volunteers who were helping move debris.
On a nearby street corner, she accepted a donation of a few flats of water bottles. It quickly evolved into one of the city’s most active donation sites, with people streaming in constantly with donations of tools, food and medical supplies, and she has operated it ever since.
“My neighborhood was in chaos. I can’t stay in my house,” she said.
At first, government officials told her no more help was needed. But volunteers continued showing up with donations and to offer help at rescue sites. “They finally decided it was better that we work together,” she said. “Because people aren’t going to stop helping.”
Outside a collapsed office building a few blocks away, about a hundred volunteers lined up Thursday morning to take over for crews that had worked all night.
“We’re normally so divided,” said Jose Funcia, 32, who was waiting in line with a shovel. Those divisions are across economic and cultural lines, he said. “But when it's an emergency, we come together.”
The signs of generosity appeared in more subtle ways too: Restaurants advertised free lunches, while neighbors set up power strips in their windows to allow responders to charge their phones. On Facebook, messages spread inviting the newly homeless to sleep in guest rooms and on couches. Even those directly affected purchased supplies to donate to others in need.
At times, tensions rose between these good Samaritans and officials charged with the rescue effort.
At a building in the Roma neighborhood that had previously housed a mattress store and offices, volunteers received word that a survivor might be in the rubble — or perhaps not. Desperate to help, volunteers lined up along surrounding blocks with shovels and pickaxes, while others outfitted them with gloves and face masks.
Behind caution tape, a backhoe combed through the remains of the building, prompting an outcry from volunteers who feared the heavy equipment would harm those who might still be trapped. They began shouting at soldiers, armed with automatic weapons, who were blocking access to the site.
The victims’ blood would be on their hands, people shouted. The guards stood their ground, making no eye contact with the volunteers.
The moment highlighted an inherent distrust between the public and officialdom in Mexico, where corruption is endemic and official violence is one of the tools used in its service.
Anais Martinez, a gastronomic tour guide, counts herself as usually distrustful of government officials. But when her apartment building suffered extreme damage during the earthquake this week, civil defense authorities came by quickly to evaluate and leave instructions — don’t move furniture, enter for only five-minute intervals to collect belongings, leave the rest behind.
She found herself feeling differently.
""In cases of emergency,” she said, “I think they take away the title of government officials and become fellow Mexican brothers.""

"Meet Frida, the valiant Lab who's saved a dozen lives in Mexico","One of Mexico’s most beloved rescuers wears wide protective goggles, a harness and two pairs of boots.
Frida is the star of the Mexican navy’s Canine Unit. Throughout her career, the 7-year-old Labrador has detected 52 people — 12 alive — in various natural disasters.
She detected the body of a police officer in Juchitan after an earthquake hit the state of Oaxaca two weeks ago.
Now her handlers in Mexico City are hoping she will find survivors of Tuesday’s magnitude 7.1 earthquake, which killed more than 270 people in five states. The quake’s epicenter was in the state of Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of the capital.
Fifteen dogs have been deployed to search for people in Mexico City, but none have as many Twitter admirers as Frida. The navy tweeted a collage of photos of Frida last week, announcing her 52 rescues to the social media world. It got more than 4,000 retweets and nearly 7,000 likes. People called her a symbol of hope, a hero and offered to send her more boots to keep her paws safe. (She and the other rescue dogs have enough.)


As rescue efforts enter a third day, Mexicans have been captivated by the fate of earthquake victim “Frida Sofia,” a young girl supposedly trapped under the collapsed Enrique Rebsamen school in Mexico City.


But even as Frida Sofia gained fame around the world, her story quickly began to fall apart.
Here’s what some of her fans say:
“She should rest a little. She has worked a lot. God take care of you, your work is not easy.”
“Frida for president.”
“Now you know why they say that dogs are man’s best friend.”
Someone even suggested she replace the painter Diego Rivera on the 500-peso note:
When Frida’s story went viral this week, many people confused the exact details of her rescues, with some thinking that all 52 people were alive or that all 52 people were detected during the Mexico City earthquake.
Frida was dispatched Tuesday to the collapsed Enrique Rebsamen school, where 11 children were found alive and 25 people, including 19 children, were found dead. Other emergency workers found them.
On Thursday afternoon, she napped in a break room with two Belgian Malinois colleagues, Evil and Echo. Frida’s handler, Israel Arauz Salinas, said she had suffered from exhaustion after searching the school Wednesday. But he said she was back in good spirits Thursday after drinking water with electrolytes and getting some rest.
Salinas said that because of Frida’s age, Evil and Echo, who are a year and a half old, usually go into collapsed buildings first. If they detect a person, Frida follows up to confirm. She usually spends no more than 20 minutes inside.
Salinas said they bark if they detect signs of life. If they find a corpse, they stop suddenly, then carefully proceed.
""They act afraid,"" he said. ""That indicates to us that there is a cadaver.""
He said the spaces that Frida and the other dogs have had to search are  less than 20 inches high. In some places, the dogs had to crawl, getting much deeper into the rubble than rescuers could.
Salinas said the dogs are selected for service at 2 months old. They receive training that determines whether they will go into detection of narcotics, explosives or people.
For detection of people, the training starts by throwing toys such as balls. Once the dog gets used to fetching, the trainer begins running with the toy in hand.
""They start associating the smell of the person with the reward of the ball,"" he said, adding that they train for about 3 hours a day for a year before being sent out to disaster sites.
Frida’s skills are applied not only in Mexico. Salinas said she was in Ecuador during the earthquake of April 2016.
By Thursday afternoon at the school in Mexico City, officials said that all children had been accounted for, but that one person might still be alive and trapped inside.
That means there's still a chance Frida could be sent to find out.

",
German Chancellor Merkel's unflappable style may carry her to an election victory Sunday,"After Angela Merkel was splattered with a ripe tomato hurled by a protester at a recent campaign rally, the German chancellor stayed as cool as a cucumber.
Unflappable even in the face of rising resentment over her decision to allow more than a million refugees into Germany two years ago, Merkel brushed off the tomato at the rally in Heidelberg and finished the speech in her stained blazer without saying a word about it.
The episode may help explain why so many Germans respect and appreciate Merkel, even if they do not necessarily like her. Polls indicate she is expected to win a fourth four-year term as chancellor in Sunday's  general election.
Though the imperturbable 63-year-old physicist rubbed many in the country of about 82 million people the wrong way with her refugee policies, voters in Europe’s biggest economy know her and trust her, according to pollsters and analysts.
“Germans like stability and predictability,” said Jackson Janes, a political scientist and president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “That’s why ‘no-drama-Angela’ fits the mood. With turbulence all around, including [President] Trump’s tirades in tweets, Germans see her as a good crisis manager.”
Merkel, meanwhile, embraces her reputation for staying cool when dealing with fellow leaders such as Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“I’d say I’m able stay calm in tight spots, and that serenity is an important strength to have,” Merkel said in response to a question at a discussion with voters in Stuttgart a few hours after the incident in Heidelberg. “These meetings aren’t about making new friends. If friendships emerge, that’s great. But it’s about representing the interests of your country and it’s important to make your values known.”
In power since 2005, Merkel has guided Germany through a number of difficulties including the global financial crisis in 2008 that crippled growth in the country, the euro zone debt crisis that threatened chaos for the 28-nation European Union, and the refugee crisis that opened up rifts across Germany and the EU. As an influential leader in Europe, she faces economic and diplomatic challenges stemming from Britain’s plans to exit the EU, known as Brexit.
Merkel almost never leads the way in the global arena with bold measures or spectacular new plans. But there are exceptions, such as with her refugees position, and she tends to stand firm once she makes a decision.
“Unlike a lot of other world leaders who feel the need to immediately jump on every headline, Merkel goes quiet whenever there’s a crisis and waits as long as it takes to detect which direction public opinion is leaning,” said Julius van de Laar, an international political strategist in Berlin. “It’s almost like she’s out there surfing on a wave and waiting to see the direction it breaks.”
Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union party, or CDU, has slipped slightly in recent opinion polls but is projected to win 36% of the vote Sunday and emerge as the dominant party in a new and larger Parliament filled with six parties.
The center-left Social Democratic Party, or SPD, led by candidate Martin Schulz, is well behind with about 23% of the projected vote, even though it  briefly pulled ahead of Merkel’s party early this year.
The Social Democrats unexpectedly lost three state elections in the spring to Merkel’s conservatives and gave up all the campaign momentum they had garnered when Schulz was nominated in January.
The SPD was surprised and unprepared to suddenly lead the Christian Democratic Union party in polls and failed to capitalize on the burst of support for Schulz, analysts said. He largely stayed on the sidelines during the three state elections, whereas Merkel campaigned hard for her party in all three states that served as important test runs for the general election.
In addition, the country’s economy has grown strongly during Merkel’s 12 years in power while unemployment has fallen steadily and is at 5.7%. The federal government has been running a budget surplus of up to $25 billion a year for the last three years.
“Merkel’s position isn’t as strong as it was in the previous elections, but she has a broad base of support,” said Van de Laar. “The booming economy and low unemployment is a partial explanation. But she has also hardly faced any challenge from the SPD.”
If she wins reelection, Merkel will nevertheless need a coalition partner to govern the country and that will be the biggest uncertainty Sunday.
She could pick the SPD for another “grand coalition” similar to the right-center alliance that ruled since 2013 or opt for a new government with one or two smaller parties on the ballot — such as the pro-ecology Greens or pro-business Free Democrats, which are each polling just under 10%. The far-left Linke party is also polling around 10%.
Merkel and all other parties in Parliament have already ruled out any alliance with the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which has campaigned unabashedly against the refugees from Syria and other trouble spots flooding into Germany. The AfD is expected to win seats in the Reichstag for the first time, with perhaps 10% of the vote or more.
Pollsters believe the AfD, which was formed in 2013 as an anti-euro party and fell short of the 5% threshold for inclusion in Parliament in the September 2013 election, could win more than 10% this time. Many of its supporters, who intensely dislike Merkel and her pro-refugee policies, may be concealing their true voting intentions in voter surveys, pollsters say.
“The refugee issue isn’t the red-hot topic it was a year ago,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University, noting the numbers of applications for asylum and media attention on refugees have diminished sharply this year. “Support for Merkel still runs high across the country, but the difference this time is that there is a considerable minority of perhaps 15% that viscerally opposes her.”
That animosity can be seen especially at rallies in the formerly communist east, where sizable numbers of unruly hecklers have tried to disrupt her campaign rallies with nonstop whistling and jeers lasting the duration of her 40-minute stump speeches. But it’s also been visible in some affluent western towns such as Heidelberg, where she was hit by the tomato.
“She’s bounced back from the uproar over the immigrant wave because there hasn’t been another wave yet and she addressed the border control issues more directly,” said Janes. “Her biggest challenge ahead is going to be holding Europe together while negotiating Brexit.”

Death toll from Mexico's earthquake climbs to 230 as frantic search continues for survivors,"Mexico's seismological agency said the epicenter was east of the capital in the state of Puebla. (Sept. 20, 2017)


Mexico's seismological agency said the epicenter was east of the capital in the state of Puebla. (Sept. 20, 2017)
Firefighters, soldiers and volunteers, at times working with bare hands and donated flashlights, searched massive piles of rubble for any signs of life Wednesday after a violent earthquake that toppled buildings across central Mexico.
There were moments of relief when still-breathing, dust-covered survivors were pulled from the wreckage and transported to hospitals. But many others were found dead.
Tuesday’s magnitude 7.1 earthquake, the second to strike Mexico in as many weeks, killed at least 230 people in the capital and across five states. Officials said the toll was likely to rise.
Some of the most heart-wrenching scenes played out at a three-story school building that pancaked into a pile of concrete rubble on the south side of Mexico City. Rescue workers extracted at least 25 bodies from the ruins, all but four of them children.
Five people were killed at the Mexico City campus of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, the school said in a statement. Scores more died in collapsed apartment buildings and office towers.
The quake hit on the anniversary of a 1985 temblor that killed thousands and devastated large parts of Mexico City. The epicenter was in the state of Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of the capital.
President Enrique Peña Nieto toured some of the worst-hit parts of the city and also visited the state of Morelos. He declared three days of national mourning to honor the victims, telling their relatives and loved ones, ""Mexico shares your pain.""
With glass and debris strewn across the capital and power still out in places, many residents would need help in the coming days, he said in a video address to the nation late Tuesday. But the first priority would be to rescue those still trapped under the rubble and provide medical care to the injured.
""As Mexicans, we have experienced difficult times because of earthquakes in the past, and we have learned to respond with dedication and a spirit of solidarity,"" he said.
President Trump called his Mexican counterpart Wednesday to extend his condolences for the lives lost and damage caused by the quake, according to a statement from the White House. Trump also offered assistance, including search-and-rescue teams, which were being deployed to Mexico, the statement said.
The president was criticized by opponents for not immediately expressing sympathy for Mexico after another deadly earthquake struck off the country’s southern coast on Sept. 7 and a hurricane made landfall two days later. At the time, Trump blamed poor cellphone reception in the mountains of Mexico for the delay in reaching Peña Nieto.
“God bless the people of Mexico City,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “We are with you and will be there for you.”
Federal authorities in Mexico struggled to confirm the number of dead and injured amid the chaos of a rescue operation spread across hundreds of miles, revising their figures several times Wednesday.
As of Wednesday evening, the death toll stood at 230, according to a tweet from Luis Felipe Puente, Mexico’s national coordinator for civil protection. They included 100 people killed in the autonomous district of Mexico City, 69 in Morelos, 43 in the state of Puebla and 13 in Mexico state. There were four deaths in Guerrero state and one in Oaxaca state.
At least 800 people were injured in Mexico City. Signs of the quake were all over the city Wednesday: broken glass under a business awning; swept-up piles of brick, concrete and steel rebar; caution tape blocking structurally unsound doorways.
School was canceled for the day and many businesses were closed, alleviating the city’s usual heavy traffic.
Hordes of people gathered at the sites of dozens of collapsed buildings. They came from all walks of life, bringing water, food and safety supplies. They asked how they might help. There were so many of them that sometimes they had to be turned away.
Outside a damaged apartment building in the neighborhood of Lindavista, north of the city center, dozens of volunteers formed a human chain, passing jugs of water, rope, hard hats and shovels. Police officers kept order, blowing whistles as they directed Red Cross and other emergency crews.
Aides at the scene said the bottom three floors of the six-story building had caved in, trapping people inside.
""Medico!"" someone yelled from beyond an orange barrier set up to keep the public at bay. Two women in white doctor’s coats sprang over the blockade, one of them nearly tripping on her way, and ran toward the wreckage.
As workers shoveled away rubble, word spread that the building was in danger of further collapse. Trucks soon arrived at the barrier with thick wooden posts to reinforce the collapsed third floor, which was held up precariously by the first floor's pillars.
Across the region, authorities appealed for donations of food and water to sustain rescuers and for flashlights to assist the searches that would go on into the night.
18 hours after the collapse, rescuers still paused every few minutes to listen for survivors.
In the upscale neighborhood of Condesa, in the center of Mexico City, several dozen people pressed against police tape surrounding a collapsed office building, watching in anxious silence as ambulances circled with sirens blaring and firefighters desperately searched the rubble for survivors.
They were the mothers, sisters, cousins, husbands and wives of people trapped inside the wreckage of the multistory building.
In the the seven hours that Concepcion Chavez Lopez had been waiting there, she had seen more than a dozen people pulled alive from the wreckage. None had been her son, Gustavo Banda Chavez, 23, or her brother, Miguel Angel Chavez Lopez, 48, who worked together in an accounting firm on the building's fourth floor.
Chavez, 51, could barely utter her name when someone asked for it shortly before midnight Tuesday. She and a small group of relatives kept their eyes trained on the scene in front of them: firefighters picking their way across a towering heap of bricks, chunks of concrete and twisted metal, their work illuminated by floodlights.

As he stood watching the office building, all Alejandro Santiago hoped for was to hear the name Paulina Gomez.
It would mean that somebody had found his 28-year-old cousin , a human resources administrator who worked on the fourth floor, somewhere beneath the rubble. It would mean that her name could join the list of people who had been rescued, which authorities were writing on a piece of poster board attached to a light post.
But Santiago, also 28, hadn’t heard anything. So he waited, and watched. At one point, police had asked the family members to move farther from the scene. They refused.
“We’re not moving until we find out what happened to them,” he said.
Miguel Angel Pimienta Avalos, 63, arrived outside a collapsed apartment block in Condesa at 10 p.m. Tuesday hoping to find his niece, who lived on the fifth floor of the six-story building.
When the quake hit, he had called every family member to make sure they were safe. She was the only person who didn’t answer.
“When I saw the photos on the Internet, I said, ‘It’s not likely that they’ll get people out,’ ” he said, looking away as he fought back tears. “Hopefully there is a miracle.”
Just across from the apartments, medics had turned a building for representatives from the state of Durango into a makeshift base for family members of the missing. Members of 13 families had signed in throughout the night. None of their loved ones had been found by morning, and most had left by daybreak.
Ten hours after he arrived, Avalos was the only one left, volunteering to pass the time, and praying to God.
Nurses set up a sidewalk clinic, while others walked around offering pastries and water. Dozens of people stood watch, their mouths covered with face masks, as volunteers atop a mountain of rubble passed debris down in buckets. Others carted rubble away from the ground in wheelbarrows.
One rescue worker brought a yellow Labrador retriever to the top of the pile to sniff out bodies. Suddenly, workers dimmed the lights, cut off the generators and called for silence. They listened. A few minutes later, they resumed their work.
By nightfall, the mound had been reduced. It had a slope instead of a peak.Workers pounded at what remained of apartments with sledgehammers and cut through pieces of metal rebar with a torch. 
They barely paused to put on plastic ponchos when a storm hit the city around 7:30 p.m., dropping sheets of rain onto the site and making the mountain look soggy.
Dr. Karen Pina Fragoso, who was working at the scene, said a handful of people had survived the collapse. Two walked out on their own Tuesday night, and three or four were rushed to a hospital. She didn’t know how many adults remained missing in the building, but said at least three children were unaccounted for.
Fragoso said medics could still hear the voices of many people trapped in the building at 3 a.m. But as daylight broke, the voices quieted.

"Eleven coffins, all in a row: One of the worst of Mexico's earthquake tragedies unfolded at the church in Atzala","It was supposed to be a joyous occasion, the baptism of a baby girl in this sweltering sugar-cane hub south of Mexico City.
But the celebration at Santiago the Apostle Catholic Church turned abruptly tragic Tuesday when a massive earthquake rocked violently through the main square.
The colonial-style church shuddered, and chunks of masonry crashed to the ground. Eleven people were killed.
Among the victims: Three-month-old Elideth Torres de Leon, who was to be baptized; her sister, Maria, 8; and the girls’ mother, Manuela de Leon Garcia, 27.
Much of the world’s attention has focused on Mexico City in the aftermath of the 7.1 earthquake, which killed at least 230 people and left thousands across central Mexico homeless. Here in Atzala, an isolated town of 1,200 that subsists mainly off agriculture and money sent home by those who’ve gone to work in the U.S., the impacts have been especially deep, and unforgettable.
The town lies just 20 miles from the epicenter of Tuesday’s quake, in neighboring Morelos state.The death toll at the church was among the highest number of casualties recorded anywhere in the country in a single venue.
The coffins of the 11 people killed in the church collapse were lined up together on Wednesday as stunned friends, relatives and townsfolk said goodbye — the baptism had instead become a funeral Mass.
Some were bidding final farewells to multiple relatives or neighbors, people who had been essential parts of their lives for years, sometimes decades. There was a general sense of disbelief that they had been taken away so suddenly.
“I am in profound pain. I am shattered,” said Graciano Villanueva Perez, 73, who lost six relatives —  his wife, sister, daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren, all of whom were attending the baptism. “I don’t know what to say,” he added, drifting away to the comfort of kin, his head bowed. He had been at home resting when the quake hit.
His relative, Facundo Flores Nolasco, 42, also lost six loved ones: his wife, mother, brother, daughter-in-law, a niece and a nephew. He had been returning from his fields on a bicycle with others when the quake struck.
“I’ve been through other earthquakes, but never this strong,” said Flores, a hulking man who once toiled in Colorado as an undocumented worker. “We had to get down from the bikes and wait for the shaking to end.”
When Flores returned to town, someone informed him what had happened at the church. He rushed to the hospital, but most of his relatives hadn’t lived long enough to be taken there. Still, in the midst of his losses, Flores has some hope: His 21-year-old daughter, Maria de Jesus, suffered a broken leg and internal injuries but is expected to survive.
“One never expects such a thing,” Flores murmured. 
Comforting him were his two daughters, Matilda and Annabel, who sat on metal chairs set up for the  wake. Nearby, people arranged flowers and palms to be placed by the coffins.

A baptism at Santiago the Apostle Catholic Church in Atzala turned abruptly tragic Tuesday when a massive earthquake rocked violently through the main square. Eleven people were killed.
With the church reduced to rubble, the wake and funeral service were held beneath a red-and-white tarp on a small side street. The 11 closed coffins, of different shapes and sizes, bore pieces of white tape with the first names of the deceased and stood side-by-side on metal stands.
Those gathered sat and stared into space, or chatted. Some shared soft drinks. The crowd was subdued. Some officials stopped by to pay respects.
The entire town seemed to be in mourning. Well-wishers hugged relatives of the dead, gave their condolences and offered flowers, which were placed in pots at the foot of the coffins. Burning candles stood by the flowers.
“These were all people we knew — this is a small town,” said Carmen Moran, who was among the mourners. “That was Aurelia,” she said, pointing at a coffin adorned in white frills.
Moran then gestured to other caskets. “That was Fidelia. That was Florencia. And Azcucena, the daughter of ….” Her voice trailed off.
Next to where the funeral was held, a poster plastered to a wall offered shipping services to and from the United States and Mexico. The company was based in the New York borough of Queens, where many residents of Atzala have gone to work over the years. It offered the best prices on cross-border shipments.
A few blocks away, residents gathered to gawk at the ruins of Santiago the Apostle Church. Deep fissures marred its mustard-colored facade. One of its bell towers had tumbled into the plaza in front; the other was half-destroyed. Inside, massive chunks of masonry from the roof covered the floor. Some peering in from  the street said they couldn’t help but imagine what had happened a day earlier — the shock and panic.
Outside the church, rubble and twisted trees and branches littered the once-tranquil space facing the church. Yellow police tape cordoned the area off, with police officers standing guard.
City officials cautioned of the danger that the unstable structure could come tumbling the rest of the way down.
A bulldozer gathered up debris and placed it into a dump truck as residents watched.
“We’ve never had something like this here,” said Marisela Rodriguez, 45, who runs a shop down the street from the church. “This was terrible tragedy, but thank God it did not happen … on Sunday. The church is always packed then. Practically the whole town comes out. There would have been so many more killed.”
A priest said some last prayers over the assembled coffins beneath the canopy. A few blocks away, at the town cemetery, workers had dug three holes where the bodies would be placed.
All is ready, a cemetery worker assured those assembled.
“The human toll — that’s the hard part,” said Giovanni Sanchez, 31, who once worked as a busboy in the Bronx, but returned to be with his family here. “The church can always be replaced. But not the people. They are gone now forever.”

How to help Mexico's earthquake victims,"In the wake of the deadly earthquake that shook central Mexico this week, fundraisers have been launched in Mexico and the United States to aid the thousands in need of food and shelter.
At least 230 people have been confirmed dead since the 7.1 earthquake struck Tuesday. At least 1,000 people were injured.
The quake made buildings sway violently in Mexico City, sending thousands of people fleeing into the streets in the minutes after it hit. Offices, apartment buildings and schools collapsed. Rescue workers were still searching for survivors. Here's how to help, with tips on how to pick a charity.
Topos - topos.mx (site in Spanish)
Topos de Tlateloco was founded after the devastating 1985 earthquake in Mexico that killed thousands. It is a professional nonprofit rescue brigade. Topos, which means “moles” in Spanish, is mobilizing to find survivors of this earthquake.
The organization's website has been intermittently down in the past day, but you can send them money via PayPal to donativos@brigada-rescate-topos-org.
Project Paz - projectpaz.org
Project Paz, a New York City-based nonprofit, is raising funds specifically for earthquake relief.
UNICEF Mexico - donaunicef.org.mx (site in Spanish)
The United Nations Children's Fund is accepting donations for Mexico earthquake relief. Actress Salma Hayek donated $100,000 and launched a fundraiser for UNICEF through CrowdRise. In a video message, Hayek recalls living through the 1985 quake and how “a lot of friends died, including an uncle who was very, very close to me. I have lived through the aftermath of a disaster of this magnitude. It’s horrific.”
GlobalGiving - globalgiving.org
GlobalGiving takes donations and distributes them to local recovery efforts. It has raised more than $150,000 so far for earthquake relief in Mexico. You can donate through the website or by texting MEXICO to 80100 (from the United States only). The tweet below also refers to the 8 magnitude quake that hit Mexico earlier this month.
Not all fundraisers are created equal. Sadly, after many disasters, fake charities spring up to take advantage of people's kind-heartedness. The website Charity Navigator, which evaluates nonprofit groups, has released a list of worthy organizations raising money for Mexico quake relief.
As with most disasters, relief organizations will benefit more from cash donations than sending items. Stuffed animals and blankets generally do more harm than help after a disaster. Money is really the most helpful thing to send at this time.
Is there another organization that should be listed here? Let me know on Twitter: @jessica_roy.

An off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer riding a motorcycle was killed Thursday in an accident with a car in Porter Ranch.
An off-duty LAPD officer on a motorcycle was killed in a traffic collision in Porter Ranch on Thursday evening, police said.
The officer, identified as 34-year-old John Gasparyan of Canyon Country, was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries, said Officer Mike Lopez, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
The collision was reported just before 7 p.m. near the intersection of Tampa Avenue and Chatsworth Street.
Lopez said a preliminary investigation found that Gasparyan was riding southbound on Tampa Avenue when he collided with a car ahead of him making a U-turn in the opposite direction
“Right now, it appears to be a tragic accident,” Lopez said. “However, investigators will be on scene trying to determine who was at fault.”
The driver remained at the scene after the crash and was cooperating with detectives, Lopez said.

Girl struck by car as she walked to 'unsafe' school bus stop awarded $36.1 million by San Bernardino jury

Girl struck by car as she walked to 'unsafe' school bus stop awarded $36.1 million by San Bernardino jury,"Every morning on her way to first grade at Bonnie Oehl Elementary School in Highland, Isabella Sanchez crossed a residential street mid-block to catch her bus.
One morning about two months into the 2012 school year, she dashed across and was struck by a car. She flew 70 feet into the air, her attorney said, before landing on the pavement and going into cardiac arrest several times.
Isabella, 6 at the time, survived. But she was in a coma for three months, and had a traumatic brain injury and fractures to her neck, arm, leg and pelvis. She was in a wheelchair and needed 24-hour care.
“You’re her arms, you’re her body, you’re her eyes, you’re her feelings, everything,” her mother, Carina Sanchez, 38, told The Times on Thursday. “For us to rest, like a regular person, that hasn’t happened since the day of the accident.”
Now, five years later, a jury has awarded the girl $36.1 million, ruling that Durham School Services, a private school bus company, and one of its drivers were negligent when they failed to notify the San Bernardino City Unified School District about a pattern of unsafe crossings at that bus stop.
The attorney representing the company could not be reached Thursday.
The company “is supposed to be the eyes and ears of the school district to monitor all things that are unsafe that occur out at the bus stops,” said Geoffrey Wells, an attorney who represented the Sanchez family. “Everyone admitted that bus driver had an absolute duty to report that and get the safety people out there right away.”
The verdict comes after a five-week trial in which four mothers, Wells said, testified that they jaywalked daily in front of the bus driver to get to the bus stop. A traffic light stood about four houses down the block.
Wells said the school district’s transportation director testified that the district relies on drivers to report dangerous conditions at bus stops, including unsafe mid-block crossings.
Two bus drivers also testified, Wells said, that they didn’t see the dangerous crossings. Neither was fired, he added.
The jury deliberated for two days, Wells said, before reaching the 11-1 verdict.
The jury also found Isabella’s mother negligent, which Wells said he admitted, and 20% responsible for her daughter’s harm because she endorsed the dangerous route to school. She was not there the day of the crash, Wells said. Isabella walked to the bus stop with a neighbor.
After the verdict, Sanchez said she felt relieved that her daughter could get the medical care she needs.
“More than anything I don’t want any other little kid to go through what I’ve been going through,” Sanchez said. “We’re trusting the bus companies with our kids, for them to have a better future, and we don’t want nothing to happen to them.”

"LAPD union sues Chief Charlie Beck, city over complaint forms","Frustrated that the Los Angeles Police Department won’t warn people that knowingly filing false complaints against officers is against state law, the union representing the LAPD’s rank and file is taking the matter to court.
The Los Angeles Police Protective League sued the police chief and the city this week, demanding that the LAPD add such warnings to the forms people can fill out when alleging misconduct by officers.
The lawsuit, however, hinges on a hotly contested California statute that says making a purposefully false allegation against police is a misdemeanor. The law requires agencies to advise people of that potential crime when they make allegations against police.
The lawsuit calls on the court to determine the admonition is “legally valid, enforceable and must be implemented” by the LAPD and to stop the department from accepting complaints without the warning.
Police officers have long complained about what they perceive to be purposefully false accusations of misconduct, saying such reports are stressful and can stall their careers as they wait to be cleared by internal investigators. But police watchdogs and free speech advocates who have contested the law in court have also argued that such warnings could dissuade valid complaints against police.
“There’s an enormous chilling effect,” said Peter Eliasberg, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.
Dustin DeRollo, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said the lawsuit is focused only on knowingly false complaints and does not seek to change “in any way” legitimate ones made against officers.
“False allegations, they hurt the careers and families of police officers. They hurt the officer’s reputation, they could prevent them from promoting or keep them out of the field where they could be out protecting residents,” DeRollo said. “They do have a substantial impact, and we’d like to see that curbed.”
“If you’re not purposefully lying about a police officer, you have nothing to worry about,"" he added.
An LAPD spokesman declined to comment Thursday, saying the department had not yet seen the lawsuit.
The law prohibiting knowingly false allegations against police officers has been the subject of a legal back-and-forth dating back more than a decade.
In 2002, the California Supreme Court ruled that the law was constitutional, overturning a lower court’s decision that it violated the 1st Amendment by prohibiting knowingly false allegations of misconduct against police officers and no one else.
In 2005, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals weighed in on a different case that originated in El Cajon. The court concluded that the law violated the 1st Amendment because it criminalized knowingly false speech that was critical of police but not knowingly false speech that supported officers.
“It’s the worst form of stacking the deck in favor of law enforcement,” said Eliasberg with the ACLU, which was involved in both cases.
The Los Angeles police union’s lawsuit contends that the 9th Circuit’s ruling was “incorrectly decided.” The lawsuit notes that the statute still exists in the state penal code.
“The admonishment has never been repealed,” said Richard Levine, who is representing the Police Protective League.
Despite the 9th Circuit’s decision, it cannot compel California’s Legislature to remove the law from the books, Eliasberg said.
“It’s really a shame the PPL wants to spend its time engaging in this kind of lawsuit,” Eliasberg said. “A federal appeals court has held that it’s an unconstitutional statute.”

"Woman barges into Kardashians' WeHo boutique with gun, returns later with 14-inch machete","A woman barged into the Kardashians’ clothing boutique in West Hollywood on Thursday, pulling out a revolver and pointing it at the sales staff before returning later with a machete.
About 11:30 a.m., the woman entered Dash, pointed a handgun at an employee and shouted, “Stay away from Cuba,” according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. She then knocked items off a counter and pointed the gun at a second employee, mumbling incoherently before she left. 
Deputies, with the help of a police helicopter, conducted a “thorough search” to locate the woman, described as about 5 foot 10 and 170 pounds, with blond hair and a bandanna tied around her forehead. They couldn’t find her.
About two hours after her first visit, the woman returned to the shop wielding a 14-inch machete. She paced back and forth outside the exclusive Melrose Avenue store, shouting and waving the machete. 
Photographers covering the gun incident captured images. She then wedged the machete into the front doorway and left, walking west on Melrose Avenue toward La Cienega Boulevard. 
A second search was conducted, but again, the woman wasn’t found. Investigators are examining security video of the incidents in an effort to identify the woman.
Last year, a passerby called 911 and reported seeing a man throw a “lit object” through the store’s front-door window.
The attack broke the door’s glass but didn’t cause any significant damage inside. When deputies arrived to investigate, they found the “heavy object” smoldering inside the store, but nothing else had been burned.
Anyone with information about the machete-wielding woman is asked to call West Hollywood detectives at (310) 358-4055.

Milo Yiannopoulos plans to speak at Cal State Fullerton despite protests and criticism,"Conservative firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos will speak at Cal State Fullerton on Oct. 31, the campus' College Republicans chapter announced amid an attempt to block the appearance.
A petition on the website change.org asking Cal State Fullerton administrators to block the speech has drawn nearly 5,000 signatures.
“If we start banning certain types of speakers like Milo, then the restrictions used to shut down those you don't agree with can be used against those who imposed them in the first place,'' said chapter member Michael Garcia.
A scheduled speech by Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley in February triggered violent protests against him and those who showed up to see him, some of whom were injured. The speech was canceled.
The College Republicans at Cal State Fullerton chose Yiannopoulos to speak on campus because of his ability to spark discussions regarding free speech on college campuses, chapter president Amanda McGuire said.
“CSUF has long been an institution celebrating diversity,'' McGuire said. “Inviting a controversial speaker like Milo has created a conversation throughout campus as students consider what it means to have freedom of speech.
“For too long, left-leaning groups have dominated campus culture and marginalized conservative thinkers through intimidation tactics and violent protests,” she said. “The CSUF Republicans provides a place for all voices to be heard.''

LAX gets dismal passenger satisfaction ranking while John Wayne Airport wins high marks,"Los Angeles International Airport came in second-to-last among 18 mega airports in a passenger satisfaction study released Thursday, while John Wayne Airport in Orange County ranked highest among large airports in the United States.
The low ranking for LAX comes amid several major projects underway, in the works or recently completed, including construction of a $1.6-billion terminal that began earlier this year, the addition of high-end stores and eateries, and an automated people mover that will take travelers to and from a centralized car rental location.
LAX was not the only big-city airport whose ranking suffered from big projects, according to Costa Mesa-based J.D. Power, which which based its 12th traveler satisfaction study on responses from 34,695 North American passengers. The airports were categorized by size: mega, large and medium.
“Despite the most creative efforts to address traveler frustration, major city airports that are in the thick of massive construction efforts — notably Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, Los Angeles International and Chicago O’Hare — are still fighting the headwinds of traveler disruption and access challenges that are handicapping their overall satisfaction scores,” according to J.D. Power. Newark Liberty is in New Jersey, LaGuardia in Queens, N.Y.
Michael Taylor, who heads the firm’s Travel Practice, added: “The trifecta of a steadily improving economy, record passenger volume and billion-dollar renovation projects unfolding in airports across the country has created a challenging environment for customer satisfaction. The fact that many airports are overcoming those challenges is incredibly instructive for the industry as it remodels and improves airport infrastructure.”
Overall passenger satisfaction with U.S. airports reached an all-time high in the study, as technology innovation and personal attention are helping ease the stress of traveling.
“Capacity has become a huge challenge for North American airports, with many reporting 100% of available parking spots being filled and large airports, such as Orlando International, setting passenger volume records each month for more than three years straight,” Taylor said. “Despite these difficulties, airports are responding with new technology and old-fashioned personal skills to win over harried travelers. These range from smartphone apps that tell travelers where to find a parking spot to therapy dogs — and in one case, a therapy pig — mingling with travelers to relieve stress and improve the overall airport experience.”
Florida’s Orlando International Airport ranked the highest in satisfaction among mega airports, with a score of 778, while Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport ranked second at 767. Tied for third were McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, each with 765. LAX’s score was 712.
John Wayne Airport’s score of 796 was the best among large airports, beating Florida’s Tampa International Airport at 795 and Dallas Love Field at 790. San Diego International Airport came in eighth place with a score of 757.
Sacramento International Airport ranked highest among medium-size airports, with a score of 810. Indianapolis International Airport ranked second at 807, and Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport was third at 806. Ontario International Airport came in 10th at 782, and Hollywood Burbank Airport came in 14th at 779, tied with General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee.

San Francisco allows fresh fish again at Fisherman's Wharf,"Fresh fish are returning to San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf.
Starting this weekend, San Francisco will allow fishermen to sell dabs, sole and rockfish from their boats at the popular tourist spot as part of a one-year pilot program.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported that San Francisco banned such sales in 2000 but reversed its policy on Sept. 12 after a campaign by fishermen looking to increase their income.
The port is allowing only whole, gutted fish to be sold at a limited part of the harbor and only by San Francisco fishermen, comparing the program to a farmers’ market for fish.
Some seafood purveyors who already sell filleted fish at the wharf expressed concerns about the program, saying non-refrigerated fish is more vulnerable to contamination.

"On last day of summer, California is hit by unusual snow and hail storms","Snow fell in Sierra Nevada on the last day of summer, giving the towering mountain range shared by California and Nevada a wintry look in September and making travel hazardous.
Sixteen vehicles crashed on Interstate 80 as snow and hail fell Thursday, killing a man driving a pickup truck and causing minor injuries to a few other people, said California Highway Patrol Officer Chris Nave.
Snow dusted peaks in Yosemite National Park and temporarily closed Tioga Pass road, the soaring eastern entry to the park that typically doesn’t become impassable until mid-November.
Several inches of snow were expected at elevations of at least 6,000 feet in the northern Sierra, said National Weather Service forecaster Hannah Chandler in Sacramento.
“The last days of summer,” the Placer County Sheriff’s Office wryly tweeted in a post showing snow falling on patrol vehicles at its Lake Tahoe station.
Sugar Bowl, a ski resort perched atop Donner Summit, received a good snow dusting that’s getting skiers excited about the upcoming ski season, said resort spokesman Jon Slaughter.
“We’ve got people calling about season passes and checking our webcams to take a look at the first snow,” Slaughter said.
Slaughter, however, didn’t anticipate the storm having much of an effect on how early the resort can open because the snow will likely melt.
But the first snow of the season came just four months after Sugar Bowl’s last ski season ended with nearly 800 inches of snowfall, part of a very wet winter that gave California at least a temporary respite from years of drought that left the Sierra with scant snowcaps.
At Oroville Dam, where crews are rushing to repair two badly damaged spillways before California’s winter rainy season starts in earnest, dam operators were keeping an eye on forecasts.
“We’re definitely tracking the weather but it has had no impact and we don’t expect it to,” said Erin Mellon, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources.
The taste of winter was not expected to last long.
“Fall is a big transition period so we have these big dips in temperature and then we go higher,” said Chandler, the forecaster. “It’s kind of a weather rollercoaster.”
Southern California also took an early leap into fall, with cloudy skies and rain showers across the region in advance of the autumnal equinox at 1:02 p.m. Friday.
